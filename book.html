    <p>
      As a savvy consumer, you should always be on the alert for shady
      deals and scams. To avoid becoming a victim, keep these things in
      mind:
    </p>
    <ol><li>
        <p>
          A deal that sounds too good to be true usually is! Be wary of
          promises to fix you credit problems, low-interest credit card
          offers, deals that let you skip credit card payments,
          work-at-home job opportunities, risk-free investments, and
          free travel.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Don’t share personal information with someone you don’t trust.
          Learn how to recognize fraud.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Beware of payday and tax refund loans. Interest rates on these
          loans are usually excessive. A cash advance on a credit card
          may be a better option.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Read and understand any contract or legal document you are
          asked to sign. Do not sign a contract with blank spaces or
          where the terms are incomplete. Some contracts include a
          clause that prohibits you from taking legal action and require
          you to engage in mandatory arbitration with a company in the
          case of a dispute.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get estimates from several contractors for home or car
          repairs. Make sure the estimates are for the exact same
          repairs for a fair comparison.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Before you buy, make sure you understand and accept the
          store’s refund and return policies, especially for services
          and facilities that charge monthly fees.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          When paying for your purchases, double-check the final price.
          If you think the price that has been charged is incorrect,
          speak up. Remember, when shopping online, your purchase may
          include additional fees, such as shipping, handling, and
          convenience fees that are not calculated until you check out.
        </p>
      </li></ol>
    <p>
      7. When shopping online, look for the padlock icon in the bottom
      corner of your screen or a URL that begins with “https” to ensure
      that your payment information is transmitted securely.
    </p>
    <ol><li>
        <p>
          Don’t buy under stress. Avoid making big-ticket purchases
          during times of duress (e.g., coping with a death or debt).
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          If you are having difficulty making payments on loans, notify
          your lender immediately so that you can work out a payment
          plan.
        </p>

  <section id="before_you_buy" data-type="sect1"><h1>Before You Buy</h1>
    
    <p>
      To avoid problems and make better decisions, use this checklist
      BEFORE you make a purchase:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Decide in advance exactly what you want and what you can
          afford.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Do your research. Ask family, friends, and others you trust
          for advice based on their experience. Gather information about
          the seller and the item or service you are purchasing.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Review product test results and other information from
          consumer experts. See Key Information Resources (p. 59) or
          check the <em>Handbook</em> index (p. 147) for
          specific information.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get advice and price quotes from several sellers.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Make sure the seller has all appropriate licenses. Doctors,
          lawyers, contractors, and other service providers must
          register with a state or local licensing agency.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
<aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Drip Pricing</h5>
  
  <p>
    Have you ever planned to make a purchase, only to find out that
    there are additional, sometimes mandatory, fees that weren’t
    included in the advertised price? The total cost is not revealed
    until the end of the purchasing process. If so, you have been the
    victim of drip pricing. This practice makes it difficult for
    consumers to determine the full cost and compare similar options,
    when all the fees aren’t disclosed up front. You can protect
    yourself by reading the policies before completing the sale and
    asking questions of sales personnel. Also, if you have charged your
    purchase on your credit card, you may be able to dispute the extra
    fees if they are more than you had agreed to with the seller.
  </p>
</aside>
  <ul><li>
      <p>
        Check out a company’s complaint record with your local consumer
        affairs office (p. 112) and Better Business Bureau (p. 67).
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        Get a written copy of guarantees and warranties.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        Get the seller’s refund, return, and cancellation policies.
      </p>
    </li></ul>
<aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Quick Tips for Avoiding Fraud</h5>
  
  <p>
    There are many varieties of consumer fraud, but the most common ones
    are variations of fake check scams, credit repair, free trip offers,
    and sweepstakes. Here are some tips to help you avoid being a
    victim:
  </p>
  <ul><li>
      <p>
        <strong>Don’t give out personal
        information</strong>. Be suspicious of anyone you don’t know
        who asks for your Social Security number, birthdate, credit card
        number, bank account number, password, or other personal data.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        <strong>Don’t be intimidated</strong>. Be
        suspicious of calls or e-mails that want you to provide or
        verify personal information immediately. Answer that you’re not
        interested and hang up or don’t reply to the e-mail.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        <strong>Monitor your accounts</strong>. Review
        bank and credit card statements carefully, and report
        unauthorized transactions to your financial institution
        immediately.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        <strong>Use a shredder.</strong> Tear or shred
        credit offers, bank statements, insurance forms, and other
        papers with personal information.
      </p>
    </li></ul>
</aside>
 <ul><li>
     <p>
     Ask whom to contact if you have a question or problem.
   </p>
   </li><li>
  <p>
    Read and understand any contract or legal document you are asked to
    sign. Make sure there are no blank spaces. Insist that any extras
    you are promised be put in writing.
  </p>
  </li><li>
      <p>
        Consider paying by credit card. If you have a problem, you can
        dispute a charge made on your credit card (p. 13).
      </p>
  </li><li>
   <p>
    Don’t buy on impulse or under pressure; this includes donating to
    charity.
  </p>
  </li></ul>
  </section>
    <section id="service_contracts_and_extended_warranties" data-type="sect1"><h1>Service Contracts And Extended Warranties</h1>
    
    <p>
      Service contracts or “extended warranties” can add hundreds of
      dollars to your purchase price, but they are rarely worth the
      cost. Some duplicate warranty coverage you get automatically from
      a manufacturer or dealer. Ask these questions before you agree to
      one of these contracts:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Does the dealer, the manufacturer, or an independent company
          back the service contract?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          How are claims handled? Who will do the work, and where will
          it be done?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          What happens to your coverage if the dealer or administrator
          goes out of business?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Do you need prior authorization for repair work?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Are there any situations when coverage can be denied? You may
          not have protection from common wear and tear, or if you fail
          to follow recommendations for routine maintenance.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
  </section>
    <section id="product_safety_recalls" data-type="sect1"><h1>Product Safety Recalls</h1>
    
    <p>
      Before you buy a used vehicle or other second-hand product, check
      to be sure that it hasn’t been recalled for safety reasons. Some
      recalls ban the sale of an item, while others ask consumers to
      return the item for replacement or repair. Sometimes, a seller
      will provide a part that reduces the danger of using the product.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re buying a product for a child, be especially careful.
      Each year, there are approximately 100 recalls of children’s
      products such as toys, clothing, cribs, and costume jewelry. Visit
      the websites in the “Check Here for Recalls” box to find the
      latest safety recalls. You can also sign up for free e-mail
      notifications at
      <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpsclist.aspx">www.cpsc.gov/cpsclist.aspx</a> or

  </section>
    <section id="identifying_and_stopping_fraud" data-type="sect1"><h1>Identifying And Stopping Fraud</h1>
    
    <p>
      Look for these warning signs to avoid fraud:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          You are asked for your bank account or credit card number.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Someone you don’t know offers you the chance to receive a
          credit card, loan, prize, lottery, or other valuable item, but
          asks you for personal data to claim it.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          The solicitation looks like a government document and suggests
          that contest winnings or unclaimed assets are yours for a
          small fee. (The government doesn’t solicit money from
          citizens.)
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Someone you don’t know asks you to send money or money orders
          to claim a prize, lottery, credit card, loan, or other
          valuable offer.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          An unknown caller claiming to be a lawyer or in law
          enforcement offers to help you get your money back (for a
          fee).
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          The deal is only good “for today” or a short time.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          A “repair person” suddenly finds a dangerous defect in your
          car or home.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          You are given little or no time to read a contract.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          A sale item is suddenly unavailable, but a “much better item”
          is available for slightly more money.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Someone is trying to scare you into making a purchase.

    <p>
      Late delivery, shipment of wrong or damaged items, and hidden
      costs are common complaints when consumers shop from home. To
      avoid problems and resolve them more easily, follow the advice in
      the Before You Buy checklist (p. 2). In addition, here are some
      general tips:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Be wary of post office
          boxes</strong> and sellers in other countries. It may be
          difficult to find the seller to resolve a problem later.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Know the total price.</strong> Make
          sure it includes all charges, shipping, handling, insurance,
          and taxes. Coupons and other discounts should be deducted properly.

        <strong>Keep a record of your

        such as order confirmation number, product description, delivery
        date, cancellation policy, privacy policy, warranties, and order
        confirmation numbers.
      </p>

      </p>
    </li></ul>
  <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Your Rights</h2>
    
  <p>
    When you order something by mail, phone, or online, the Federal
    Trade Commission (FTC) requires the company to:
  </p>
  <ul><li>
      <p>
        Ship the merchandise within the time promised, or if no specific
        delivery time was stated, within 30 days of receiving your
        order.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        Notify you if the shipment cannot be made on time and give you
        the option of waiting longer or getting a refund.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        Cancel your order and return your payment if the new shipping
        date cannot be met, unless you agree to another delay.
      </p>
    </li></ul>
  <p>
    If you cancel your order, your money must be refunded within seven
    days (or your account must be credited within one billing cycle if
    you charged the order). The company can’t substitute a store credit.
    If you applied for a charge account with the merchant at the same
    time that you placed your order, the company has an extra 20 days to
    ship the merchandise to allow time for processing your application.
  </p>
  <p>
    These FTC rules only apply to the first shipment of magazine
    subscriptions or other merchandise you receive repeatedly. Orders
    for services (for example, photo finishing), sale of seeds and
    growing plants, and collect-on-delivery (C.O.D.) orders, are covered by a different FTC
    rule. Your state may also have rules that apply. Report suspected
    violations to your state or local consumer protection agency (p.
    112) and to the FTC (p. 107).
  </p>
<aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Online and Group Coupons</h5>
  
  <p>
    In addition to the traditional coupons found in newspapers, coupons
    can be found online. They may be found on manufacturers’,
    companies’, dedicated coupon, or social media websites.

    Group coupons are another online saving tool. Local companies offer
    reduced prices for things like spa services, gourmet meals, and
    outdoor adventures through a third-party company; then you pay the
    third-party company to take advantage of the deal. Group coupons
    allow you to try new experiences by reducing the trial cost. Before
    you purchase a group coupon, ask yourself, “Am I really going to use
    this?” If the answer is no, don’t buy it.

  <section data-type="sect2"><h2>3-Day Cooling-Off Rule</h2>
    
  <p>
    This federal law, which dates back to 1972, protects consumers in
    their homes during door-to-door sales pitches or at sales in
    temporary business locations. According to the FTC, the 3-Day
    Cooling-Off Rule does NOT apply to the purchase of new automobiles
    or items sold online. It only applies when a company is selling
    something that costs $25 or more at a location other than its
    regular place of business.
  </p>
  <p>
    To comply with the 3-Day Cooling-Off Rule, a seller must inform
    buyers of their right to cancel the sale and receive a full refund
    within three business days.
  </p>
  <p>
    Be aware that there are situations in which the Cooling-Off Rule
    does not apply:
  </p>
  <ul><li>
      <p>
        You made the purchase entirely by mail, online, or telephone.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        The sale was the result of prior contact you had at the seller’s
        permanent business location.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        You signed a document waiving your right to cancel.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        Your purchase is not primarily for personal, family, or
        household use.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        You were buying real estate, insurance, securities, or a motor
        vehicle.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        You can’t return the item in a condition similar to how you
        received it.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        You bought arts or crafts at a fair, shopping mall, civic
      </p>
    </li></ul>
  <p>
    center, or school. Remember, if you paid by credit card and are
    having difficulty getting your refund, you may also be able to
    dispute the charge with your credit card company
    under the Fair Credit Billing Act. See Credit Card Billing Disputes
    (p. 13).

  <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Online shopping</h2>
  
  <p>
    Online shopping websites often offer great deals, variety, and
    convenience. However, consumers need to be careful and make informed
    decisions about their purchases. Some tips for shopping safely
    online:
  </p>
  <ul><li>
  <p>
    Stick to websites that are known or recommended.
  </p>
  </li><li>
  <p>
    Compare prices and deals, including free shipping, extended service
    contracts, or other offers.
  </p>
  </li><li>
  <p>
    Search for online coupons, known as promo codes, which may offer
    discounts or free shipping. Some sites offer promo codes for coupons
    to be used in bricks-and-mortar stores.
  </p>
  </li><li>
      <p>
        Get a complete description of the item and parts included, and
        the price, including shipping, delivery time, warranty
        information, return policy, and complaint procedure.
      </p>
    </li><li>
  <p>
    Before you finalize the order, double check the quantity and total
    price are correct.
  </p>
    </li><li>
  <p>
    Pay with a credit card. Federal law protects you if you need to
    dispute charges, but it doesn’t apply to debit cards, checks, cash,
    money orders, or other forms of payment.
  </p>
    </li><li>
  <p>
    Use a secure browser. Look for an address that starts with “https”
    rather than “http.” Also look for a closed padlock icon, usually in
    the lower right-hand corner of the screen.
  </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        Avoid making online purchases on public WiFi hotspots; these may
        not be secure, and your payment information could be stolen over
        the network. See WiFi (p. 41) for more information.
      </p>
    </li><li>
  <p>
    Print your purchase order with details of the product
    and your confirmation number. For more information, go to

  <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Online Auctions and Sellers</h2>
    
  <p>
    Many people sell items on the Internet through auctions, classified
    ads, news groups, and chat rooms. Review the Internet section (p.
    41) for safe shopping online as well as the general tips on shopping
    from home (p. 3). When participating in an online auction, remember
    to:
  </p>
  <ul><li>
      <p>
        Check how the auction works. Can you cancel a bid? Don’t assume
        that the rules one auction site uses apply to another. Some
        sites offer step-by-step instructions that will take you through
        the bidding process.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        Find out what protections you have. Does the site provide free
        insurance or guarantees for items that are not delivered or are
        not what the seller claimed?
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        Follow the strategies used in any auction. Learn the value of
        the item before you begin bidding, then establish your top price
        and stick to it.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        Read past customers’ ratings to determine if the seller is
        reputable and delivered quality products, as promised.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        Only bid on an item if you intend to buy. If you’re the highest
        bidder, you have bought it. Auction companies often bar those
        who back out of a deal from future bidding.
      </p>
    </li><li>
      <p>
        If the seller can’t accept payment by credit card, use an escrow
        service. A third party holds your money until you get your
        purchase and approve release of your payment to the seller.
        There is a small fee, but the peace of mind is worth it.

      Even careful buyers can run into unforeseen problems later on. To
      minimize them, follow these steps after you buy:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Save all papers that come with your purchase. Keep all

  <p>
      Choosing a bank is a major decision, and there is no one right
      choice for all consumers. When you shop for a bank, you have to
      consider the actual products and services it provides as well as
      the location of branches, size of the bank, fees, and interest
      rates. Even if you conduct most transactions online or at
      automated teller machines, you want to choose a bank with quality
      customer service. Also, consider the variety of products that the
      bank provides; some banks may specialize in checking and savings
      accounts, while others are full-service banks, offering loans and
      CDs. You don’t have to maintain all of your accounts at one bank;
      you can have relationships with several to get the best rates on
      different services.
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Protect Your Pin</h5>
      
      <p>Beware of “shoulder surfers.” Be suspicious of anyone
        lurking around an ATM or watching over your shoulder
        while you use your card. Some thieves even put a device
        over the card slot of an ATM to read the magnetic strip and
        record your PIN; this is known as “skimming.” If you suspect
        criminal activity, walk away and use a different ATM.</p>
    </aside>
  <section id="atm_debit_cards" data-type="sect1"><h1>ATM/Debit Cards</h1>
    
    <p>
      With a debit card and personal identification number (PIN), you
      can use an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) to withdraw cash, make
      deposits, or transfer funds between accounts. Some ATMs charge a
      fee if you are not a member of the ATM network or are making a
      transaction at a remote location.
    </p>
    <p>
      Retail purchases can also be made with a debit card. You enter
      your PIN or sign for the purchase. Although a debit card looks
      like a credit card, the money for the purchase is transferred
      immediately from your bank account to the store’s account. When
      you use a debit card, federal law does not give you the right to
      stop payment; you must resolve problems directly with the seller.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you suspect your debit card has been lost or stolen, call the
      card issuer immediately. While federal law limits your liability
      for a lost or stolen credit card to $50, your liability for
      unauthorized use of your ATM or debit card can be much greater,
      depending on how quickly you report the loss.
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          If you report a debit card missing before it is used, you are
          not responsible for any unauthorized withdrawals.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Your liability is limited to $50 if you report the loss within
          two business days after you realize your debit card is missing
          and increases to $500 if you report the loss between two and
          60 days.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          If you have not reported an unauthorized use of a debit or ATM
          card within 60 days after your bank mails the statement
          documenting the unauthorized use, you could lose all of the
          money in your bank account as well as the unused portion of
          your line of credit established for overdrafts.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      Check the policies of your card issuer; some offer more
    </p>
    <p>
      generous limits on a voluntary basis. Generally, banks may cover
      your overdrafts under their overdraft service and impose a fee on
      your account, or they may offer you a separate line of credit that
      includes interest charges. If your bank offers an overdraft
      service, you must opt into this service for most ATM and debit
      card transactions before the bank may impose any fees. Banks must
      disclose this option, the amount of the overdraft coverage fee,
      and the customer’s right to cancel this service. For more
      information, go to
      <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov">www.consumerfinance.gov</a>.
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Before You Swipe Your Debit Card</h5>
      
    <p>
      Although both credit cards and debit cards are easy ways to pay
      for your purchases, debit cards have some different levels of
      consumer protection and potential for consumer fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="images/pdf5131_img_10.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Debit cards are directly connected to your bank account, so when
      you swipe your card, make sure you have the money in your account
      to pay immediately. If you don’t have enough money in your
      account, your bank may “lend” you the money and pay the overage.
      However, it may charge you up to $35 for this courtesy, even if
      the dollar amount the bank covered was small. Determine whether
      you can opt out of overdraft protection. Some banks also charge
      you a monthly fee for making purchases with your debit card. Since
      new fees can be added without warning, be sure to check
      periodically for changes to your account fees for using your debit
      card.
    </p>
    <p>
      Debit cards don’t offer as much protection against fraudulent use
      or if your card is lost or stolen. Also, if you need to dispute a
      purchase, you are in a weaker position because the merchant
      already has the money and will only return it if you win the
      dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, when you use your debit card to make reservations for hotels
      or rental cars, a hold is placed on your card (and your checking
      account), which can affect your other pending transactions. Even
      if the hold is removed, it may take as long as a week until the
      funds are available to you again.

  <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Savings And Checking</h1>
    
    <p>
      When it comes to finding a safe place to put your money, 
      there are a lot of options. Savings accounts, checking 
      accounts, certificates of deposit (CD), and money market 
      accounts are popular choices. Each has different rules 
      and benefits that fit different needs. The bank must 
      provide you with the account terms and conditions when 
      you open your account. When choosing the one that is 
      right for you, consider:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Minimum deposit requirements.</strong>
      Some accounts can only be set up with a minimum dollar amount. 
      If your account goes below the minimum, the bank may not pay 
      you interest on the money you deposited and you may be 
      charged extra fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Limits on withdrawals</strong>. Can you
      take money out whenever you want? Are there any penalties for doing so?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Interest</strong>. How much
      (if anything) is paid and when? Daily, monthly, quarterly, yearly? 
      To compare rates offered by local and national financial institutions,
      visit <a href="http://www.bankrate.com">www.bankrate.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Deposit insurance</strong>. Make sure
      your bank is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
      (FDIC). This agency protects the money in your checking and savings 
      accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and Individual 
      Retirement Accounts (IRAs) up to $250,000. For more 
      information, see page 106 or visit
      <a href="http://www.fdic.gov">www.fdic.gov</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Credit unions</strong>. A credit union
      is a nonprofit, cooperative financial institution owned and run 
      by its members. Like the FDIC does for banks, the National Credit 
      Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) insures a person’s savings up 
      to $250,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Convenience</strong>. How easy is it to
      put money in and take it out? Are there branches or ATMs close to 
      where you work and live? Can you bank by phone or Internet?
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are considering a checking account or another type 
      of account with check-writing privileges, add these
      items to your list of things to think about:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Number of checks</strong>. Is there a
      maximum number of checks you can write per month without incurring 
      a charge?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Check fees</strong>. Is there a monthly
      fee for the account or a charge for each check you write?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Holds on checks.</strong>Is
      there a waiting period for checks to clear before you can withdraw 
      the money from your account?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Overdrafts</strong>. If you write a
      check for more money than you have in your account, what happens? 
      You may be able to link your checking account to a savings account
      to protect yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Debit card fees</strong>. Are there fees
      for using your debit card?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Account fees.</strong> Banks can charge
      fees on your checking or savings account to cover things like maintenance, 
      withdrawals, or minimum balance rules. However, the bank must inform you 
      of the fees up front as part of your account agreement and notify you 
      when changes occur. Practices vary from bank to bank, but each must inform 
      you of the fee change on your statement, in a separate letter, or in a 
      pamphlet. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.federalreserveconsumerhelp.gov/findananswer/can-a-bank-really.cfm">www.federalreserveconsumerhelp.gov/findananswer/can-a-bank-really.cfm</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bounced checks</strong>. It’s
      your responsibility to have sufficient funds in your account to 
      cover the checks you write. If you try to cash a check, withdraw money, or
      use your debit card for an amount greater than the amount 
      of money in your account, you can face a bounced check 
      or overdraft fee. Your bank may pay for the item, but 
      charge you a fee or deny the purchase and still charge 
      you a fee. In addition, the business to which you wrote 
      the check may charge you an additional returned check 
      fee. Bounced checks can also blemish your credit
      record, so you may want to talk to your bank about overdraft
      protection. For more information, visit
      <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bounce">www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bounce</a>.

  <section id="unsolicited_checks_and_credit_offers" data-type="sect1"><h1>Unsolicited Checks and Credit Offers</h1>
    
    <p>
      If you cash an unsolicited check, you could be agreeing to pay for
      products or services you don’t want or need. In addition, those
      “guarantees” for credit cards or loans, without consideration of
      credit history, are probably a scam. Legitimate lenders never
      guarantee credit. For more information on how to identify
      fraudulent solicitations, visit
      <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">www.ftc.gov</a>.
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Phishing Scams</h5>
      
    <p>
      “Phishing” is the use of fraudulent e-mail designed to steal
      identities as well as vital personal information such as credit
      card numbers, bank account PINs, and passwords. Phishing e-mails
      often ask you to verify this type of information. Scammers also go
      “SMishing,” or phishing using text messages, by asking you to
      verify or confirm sensitive information. Legitimate companies
      never ask for your password or account number via e-mail. If
      you’re not sure whether the e-mail is trustworthy, call the
      company directly and forward the email to <em data-type="email">spam@uce.gov</em>. If you
      believe you’ve received a phishing e-mail, don’t hit reply! The
      e-mail may even threaten to disable your account. Don’t believe
      it!
    </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      Legitimate offers of credit often come in the form of “convenience
      checks,” which credit card companies enclose with your monthly
      statement. However, convenience checks may carry higher fees, a
      higher interest rate, and other restrictions. If you don’t want
      the checks, be sure to shred them to protect yourself from
      “dumpster divers” and identity thieves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watch out for checks from someone in a foreign country claiming
      that you won a lottery, for an investment, or to pay for an item
      you sold online. This could be a scam. Even if you deposit the
      check, the check may not be legal. Don’t rely on money from a
      check, especially foreign or unsolicited, until your bank says the
      check has cleared or if you know and trust the person who sent it
      to you.

  <section id="prepaid_cards" data-type="sect1"><h1>Prepaid Cards</h1>
    
    <p>
      Prepaid cards, also known as prepaid debit, stored value, or gift
      cards, are convenient ways to pay for your purchases. Banks and
      retailers issue them to offer consumers a way to make payments and
      conduct other financial transactions. You do not need to have a
      bank account or a credit history to use a prepaid card. There are
      plenty of situations where a prepaid card might be the most
      convenient choice, but be sure you understand the key terms and
      conditions BEFORE you buy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many cards carry protections similar to credit and debit cards. To
      obtain these benefits, you must follow the instructions for
      registering and activating your card. Be sure to record your card
      information, including the customer service telephone number
      listed on the back of the card in a separate place, so you can get
      a replacement if yours is lost or stolen. Some prepaid card
      issuers may charge fees for card activation, maintenance, and cash
      withdrawals.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a problem with a prepaid card, first contact the
      customer service number. If the problem still isn’t resolved, you
      may want to file a complaint with the proper authorities:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          For cards issued by retailers, contact the FTC (p. 107). You
          may also file a complaint with your local consumer protection
          office (p. 112).
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          For cards issued by national banks, contact the Office of the

      Whether you are buying or leasing a vehicle, these tips will help
      you get the best deal and avoid problems:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Decide what kind of vehicle best suits your needs and budget.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Check out the seller. For car dealers, check with your state
          or local consumer protection agency (p. 112) and Better
          Business Bureau (p. 67). If you’re buying from an individual,
          check the title to make sure you’re dealing with the vehicle’s
          owner.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Take a test drive. Drive at different speeds and check for
          smooth right and left turns. On a straight stretch, make sure
          the vehicle doesn’t pull to one side.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Handle trade-ins and financing separately from your purchase
          to get the best deal on each. Get a written price quote before
          you talk about a trade-in or dealer financing.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Shop in advance and compare financing options at your credit
          union, bank, or finance company. Look at the total finance
          charges and the Annual Percentage Rate (APR), not just the
          monthly payment.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Read and understand every document you are asked to sign.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Don’t take possession of the car until all paperwork is final.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Choose an auto insurance policy that is right for you (p. 32).
        </p>
      </li></ul>

      Do your research first and compare vehicles. Four key resources
      that offer vehicle performance, service, and safety information
      are: <em>Consumer
      Reports</em> (<a href="http://www.consumerreports.org"/>),
      <em>Motor
        Trend</em> (<a href="http://www.motortrend.com"/>),
      <em>Car and
        Driver</em> (<a href="http://www.caranddriver.com"/>),
      and Edmunds automotive books and network (<a href="http://www.edmunds.com"/>).
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
      Research the dealer’s price for the car and options. It’s easier
      to get the best price when you know what the dealer paid for a
      vehicle. The dealer invoice price is available on a number of
      websites and in printed pricing guides. <em>Consumer
      Reports</em> offers the wholesale price; this figure factors
      in dealer incentives from a manufacturer and is a more accurate
      estimate of what a dealer is paying for a vehicle.
    </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Find out whether the manufacturer is offering rebates that
          will lower the cost. For more information, visit
          <a href="http://www.autopedia.com/html/Rebate.html">www.autopedia.com/html/Rebate.html</a>.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get price quotes from several dealers. Find out if the amounts
          quoted are the prices before or after rebates are deducted.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Avoid low-value extras such as credit insurance, extended
          warranties, auto club memberships, rustproofing, and
          upholstery finishes. You do not have to purchase credit
          insurance to get a loan. See Service Contracts and Extended
          Warranties (p. 2).

          Hybrid cars are popular among consumers interested in fuel
          economy and reducing their negative impact on the environment.
          These cars combine the benefits of gasoline engines and
          electric motors and can be configured to achieve different
          objectives, such as improved fuel economy, increased power, or
          additional auxiliary power. For more information about

    <section id="dealer_versus_private-party_purchases" data-type="sect1"><h1>Dealer Versus Private-party Purchases</h1>
      
    <p>
      In general, buying a used car from a dealer is a safer option
      because you are dealing with an institution, which means you are
      better protected by law. The FTC requires dealers to post a
      Buyer’s Guide in the window of each used car or truck on their
      lot. This guide specifies whether the vehicle is being sold “as
      is” (in the vehicle’s current condition, without a warranty) or
      with a warranty, and what percentage of repair costs a dealer will
      pay under the warranty. Keep in mind that private sellers
      generally have less responsibility than dealers do for defects or
      other problems. FTC rules do not apply to private-party sales.
    </p>
    <p>
      Expect to pay higher prices at a dealer than if you buy from an
      individual. Many dealers inspect their cars and provide an
      inspection report with each one. However, this is no substitute
      for your own inspection. Some dealers provide limited warranties,
      and most sell extended warranties. Watch out for dealer warranties
      that are “power train” warranties only, and not “bumper-tobumper,”
      full-coverage warranties. It’s best to compare warranties that are
      available from other sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some dealers sell “certified” cars. This generally means that the
      cars have had a more thorough inspection and come with a limited
      warranty. Prices for certified cars are generally higher. Be sure
      to get a list of what was inspected and what is covered under the
      warranty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Purchasing a car from a private seller may save you money, but
      there are risks. The car could be stolen, damaged, or still under
      a finance agreement. If a private seller lies to you about the 
      condition of the vehicle, you may sue the individual if you have 
      evidence and you can find him or her. An individual is very unlikely 
      to provide a written warranty.
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Choose A Safe Vehicle</h5>
      
    <p>
      Crash tests can help you determine how well a vehicle will protect
      you in a crash. These organizations perform crash tests and rate
      vehicles:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>The National Highway Traffic Safety
          Administration.</strong> Each year, NHTSA (<a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov"/>)
          crashes vehicles head-on into a wall
          and bashes them broadside to test their ability to protect
          their occupants. NHTSA focuses on evaluating vehicle
          restraints such as air bags and safety belts.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>The Insurance Institute for Highway
          Safety.</strong> A different
          test by the IIHS (<a href="http://www.hwysafety.org"/>) uses
          offset-frontal car crashes to assess the protection a
          vehicle’s structure provides.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Consumer Reports.</strong> The annual
          auto issue of Consumer Reports
          (<a href="http://www.consumerreports.org"/>) rates vehicles in terms of
          overall safety. Its safety score combines crash test results
          with a vehicle’s accident-avoidance factors— emergency
          handling, braking, acceleration, and even driver comfort.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>The National Motor Vehicle Title Information System.</strong> 
          The NMVTIS (<a href="http://www.vehiclehistory.gov"/>) 
          provides information about a vehicle’s history and condition, 
          history, and, in some cases, theft.
    </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      To find out whether a manufacturer has recalled a car for safety
      defects, contact NHTSA (p. 104). If a vehicle has been recalled,
      ask the dealer for proof that the defect has been
      repaired. Used vehicles should also have a current safety
      inspection sticker if your state requires one.

    <section id="financing" data-type="sect1"><h1>Financing</h1>
      
    <p>
      Most car buyers today need some form of financing to purchase a
      new vehicle. Many use direct lending, that is, a loan from a
      finance company, bank, or credit union. In direct lending, a buyer
      agrees to pay the amount financed, plus an agreed-upon finance
      charge, over a specified period. Once a buyer and a vehicle
      dealership enter into a contract to purchase a vehicle, the buyer
      uses the loan proceeds from the direct lender to pay the
      dealership for the vehicle.
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Long-term Car Loans</h5>
      
    <p>
      Some car dealers and banks offer loans that allow you to finance
      your car for longer periods than a traditional auto loan (more
      than six years). Before you decide on the length of your auto
      loan, weigh the pros and cons. Long-term loans can make your
      monthly payments smaller and allow you to refinance the loan after
      a few years, to reduce the length of the loan. Remember, however,
      that these loans can cost more over the life of the loan because
      you are paying interest for a longer period. Also, as the car
      depreciates, you may end up owing more on your loan than the value
      of the car. This is called negative equity.
    </p>

    </aside>
    <p>
      Another common form is dealership financing, which offers
      convenience, financing options, and sometimes special,
      manufacturer-sponsored, low-rate deals. Before you make a
      financing decision, it’s important to do your research:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Decide in advance how much you can afford to spend and stick
          to your limit.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get a copy of your credit report and correct any errors before
          applying for a loan.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Check buying guides to identify price ranges and best available deals.
        </p>

    <section id="leasing" data-type="sect1"><h1>Leasing</h1>
      
    <p>
      When you lease, you pay to drive someone else’s vehicle. Monthly
      payments for a lease may be lower than loan payments, but at the
      end of the lease, you do not own or have any equity in the car. To
      get the best deal, follow this advice in addition to the general
      suggestions for buying a car (p. 8):
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          To help you compare leasing versus owning, the Consumer
          Leasing Act requires leasing companies to give you information
          on monthly payments and other charges. Check out
          <a href="http://www.leaseguide.com">www.leaseguide.com</a> and
          <a href="http://www.leasecompare.com">www.leasecompare.com</a>
          for more information.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Consider using an independent agent rather than the dealer;
          you might find a better deal. Most financial institutions that
          offer auto financing also offer leasing options.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask for details on wear and tear standards. Dings that you
          regard as normal wear and tear could be billed as significant
          damage at the end of your lease.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Find out how many miles you can drive in a year. Most leases
          allow 12,000 to 15,000 miles a year. Expect a charge of 10 to
          25 cents for each additional mile.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Check the manufacturer’s warranty; it should cover the entire
          lease term and the number of miles you are likely to drive.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask the dealer what happens if you give up the car before the
          end of your lease. There may be extra fees for doing so.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask what happens if the car is involved in an accident.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get all of the terms in writing. Everything included with the
          car should be listed on the lease to avoid your being charged
          for “missing” equipment later.
        </p>

    <section id="recalls" data-type="sect1"><h1> Recalls, “Lemon” Laws, And Secret Warranties</h1>
      
    <p>
      Sometimes a manufacturer makes a design or production mistake on a
      motor vehicle. A service bulletin notifies the dealer of the
      problem and how to resolve it. Because these free repairs are not
      publicized, they are called “secret warranties.” The National
      Highway Traffic Safety Administration maintains a database of
      service bulletins filed by manufacturers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a problem with a vehicle that is a safety hazard,
      check whether the manufacturer has recalled your vehicle. You can
      find information about service bulletins, recalls, and other
      safety defects at www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/
      rec<a href="http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/recalls/recallsearch.cfm">alls/recallsearch.cfm
      or call DOT’s Vehicle Safety</a>Hotline at 1-800-424-9393. You
      should report hazards that aren’t listed to your dealer, the
      manufacturer of the vehicle (p. 64), and NHTSA at
      <a href="http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/ivoq">www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/ivoq</a>.
      If a safety-related defect exists, the maker must fix it at no
      cost to you—even if your warranty has expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a vehicle with a unique problem that just never seems
      to get fixed, you may have a “lemon.” Some states have laws
      concerning “lemons” that require a refund or replacement if a
      problem is not fixed within a reasonable number of tries. These
      laws might also go into effect if you haven’t been able to use
      your vehicle for a certain number of days. Contact your state or
      local consumer protection office (p. 112) to learn whether you
      have such protections and what steps you must take to get your
      problem solved. If you believe your car is a “lemon”:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Give the dealer a list of the problems every time you bring it
          in for repairs.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get and keep copies of the repair orders listing the problems,
          the work done, and the dates the car was in the shop.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Contact the manufacturer, as well as the dealer, to report the
          problem. Check your owner’s manual or the directory for the
          auto manufacturer (p. 64).
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      The Center for Auto Safety (p. 109) gathers information and
      complaints concerning safety defects, recalls, service bulletins,
      and state “lemon” laws.

    <p>
      Before renting a car:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Ask what the total cost will be after all fees are included.
          There may be an airport surcharge or fees for drop-off,
          insurance, fuel, mileage, taxes, additional-drivers,
          underage-driver, and equipment rental (for items such as ski
          racks and car seats). See drip pricing on p. 2.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask whether the rental company checks the driving records of
          customers when they arrive at the counter. If so, you could be
          rejected, even if you have a confirmed reservation.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Check in advance to be sure you aren’t duplicating insurance
          coverage. If you’re traveling on business, your employer may
          have insurance that covers accidental damage to the vehicle.
          You might also have coverage through your personal auto
          insurance (p. 32), a motor club membership, or the credit card
          you use to reserve the rental.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Carefully inspect the vehicle and its tires before renting and
          when you return it. Try to return the car during regular hours
          so you and the rental staff can look at the car together to
          verify that you didn’t damage it.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Check refueling policies and charges.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Pay with a credit card rather than a debit card, to avoid
          holds on the funds in your checking account. See “Before You
          Swipe Your Debit Card” (p. 6).
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask the rental company whether a deposit is required. If so,
          ask for a clear explanation of the deposit refund policies and
          procedures.
        </p>
      </li></ul>

    <p>
      Whenever you take a car to the repair shop:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
       <p>
      Choose a reliable repair shop. Family, friends, or an
      independent consumer-rating organization should be able to help
      you. Look for shops that display various certifications that are
      current. You should also check out the shop’s record with your
      state or local consumer protection office (p. 112) or the Better
      Business Bureau (p. 67).
        </p>
        <p>
          Describe the symptoms. Don’t try to diagnose the problem.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Make it clear that work cannot begin until you have an
          estimate (in writing, preferably) and you give your okay.
          Never sign a blank repair order. If the problem can’t be
          diagnosed on the spot, insist that the shop contact you for
          authorization once it has found the trouble.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask the shop to return the old parts to you.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Follow the warranty instructions if a repair is covered under
          warranty.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get all repair warranties in writing.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Keep copies of all paperwork.

    <p>
      When you borrow money to buy a car or truck, the lender can take
      your vehicle back if you miss a payment or in some other way
      violate the contract. You should also be aware that the lender:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Can repossess with cause without advance notice
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Can insist you pay off the entire loan balance to get the
          repossessed vehicle back
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Can sell the vehicle at auction
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Might be able to sue you for the difference between the
          vehicle’s auction price and what you owe
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Cannot break into your home or physically threaten someone while taking the vehicle
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      If you know you’re going to be
      late with a payment, talk to the lender. If you and the lender
      reach an agreement, be sure to get the agreement in writing.
      Contact your state or local consumer protection office (p. 112) to
      find out whether your state gives you any additional rights.

    <section id="credit_cards" data-type="sect1"><h1>Credit Cards</h1>
      
    <p>
      There are many types of credit cards with various features, but
      there is no one best credit card. The card you use depends
      entirely on how you plan to use it. Are you going to use it for
      everyday purchases or larger purchases? Do you plan to pay your
      balance off each month?
    </p>
    <p>
      When you apply for a credit card, consider:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Annual Percentage Rate
          (APR)</strong>. If the interest rate is variable, how is it
          determined, and when can it change?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Periodic rate</strong>. This is the
          interest rate used to determine the finance charge on your
          balance each billing period.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Annual fee</strong>. While some
          cards have no annual fee, others expect you to pay an amount
          each year for being a cardholder.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Rewards programs.</strong>Can you
          earn points for flights, hotel stays, and gift certificates to
          your favorite retailers? Use the tool on
          <a href="http://www.creditcardtuneup.com">www.creditcardtuneup.com</a>to
          find the card that offers the best rewards for you.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Grace period</strong>. This is the
          number of days you have to pay your bill before finance
          charges start. Without this period, you may have to pay
          interest from the date you use your card or the date the
          purchase is posted to your account.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Finance charges</strong>. Most
          lenders calculate finance charges using an average daily
          account balance, which is the average of what you owed each
          day in the billing cycle. Look for offers that use an adjusted
          balance, which subtracts your payment from your beginning
          balance. This method usually has the lowest finance charges.
          Check whether there is a minimum finance charge.
        </p>
      </li><li>
      <p>
        <strong>Other fees</strong>. Ask about fees
        when you get a cash advance, make a late payment, or go over your
        credit limit. Some credit card companies also charge a monthly
        fee. Be careful: sometimes companies may also try to upsell by
        offering other services such as credit protection, insurance, or
        debt coverage. Visit

    <p>
      The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure
      (CARD) Act brought about sweeping protections for consumers. Among
      other things, your credit card company must comply with the rules
      below:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fees</strong>
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Cannot change rates or fees without sending you a notice 45
          days in advance in most cases
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Cannot charge you a late payment fee of more than $25,
          regardless of how much you owe—unless one of your last six
          payments was late or the credit card company can justify a
          higher fee based on the cost of late payments
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Payments</strong>
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Has to tell you how long it will take to pay off your balance
          if you make only minimum payments
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Must mail or deliver your credit card bill at least 21 days
          before your payment is due
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Interest Rates</strong>
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Cannot increase your rate for the first 12 months after you
          open an account unless you have a variable interest rate or an
          introductory rate; you are more than 60 days late paying your
          bill; or you are in a workout agreement and don’t make
          payments as arranged
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Cannot charge higher rates for purchases made before you receive 
          notice of a new rate
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      What’s more, a credit card
      company can grant credit cards to consumers under age 21 only if
      they can show they are able to make payments or have a cosigner
      for the card. More information about CARD Act protections is

    <p>
      A credit report contains information on where you work and live,
      how you pay your bills, and whether you’ve been sued or arrested
      or have filed for bankruptcy. Credit reporting agencies (CRAs)
      gather this information and sell it to creditors, employers,
      insurers, and others. The most common type of CRA is the credit
      bureau. There are three major credit bureaus:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Equifax: 1-800-685-1111 or
          <a href="http://www.equifax.com">www.equifax.com</a>. To place
          a fraud alert on your credit report, call 1-888-766-0008.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Experian: 1-888-397-3742 or

   <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Beware: “Credit Repair” Scams</h5>
   
    <p>
      Before you sign up for fee-based credit repair services,
      beware. Many of the promised services are either illegal or
      are ones you can do for free by yourself. Before you sign
      up to work with these companies, here are some tidbits to
      keep in mind:
    </p>
     <ul><li>
         <p>A credit repair company must give you a copy of the
           “Consumer Credit File Rights under State and Federal
           Law” before you sign a contract.</p>
       </li><li>
         <p>The company cannot perform any services until you
           have signed a written contract and completed a threeday
           waiting period, during which time you can cancel the
           contract without paying any fees.</p>
       </li><li>
         <p>The company cannot charge you until it has completed
           the promised services, according to the Credit Repair
           Organizations Act.</p>
       </li><li>
         <p>It is illegal to erase timely and accurate negative
           information contained in your credit history.</p>
       </li><li>
         <p>Suggestions that you create a new credit history (also
           called file segregation) by requesting an Employer
           Identification Number from the IRS are also illegal.</p>
       </li><li>
         <p>You can solve your own credit challenges by
           requesting a free copy of your credit report through
           <a href="http://www.annualcreditreport.com">www.annualcreditreport.com</a>, 
           and by working with creditors to dispute incorrect information.

   </aside>
    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>FICO</h2>
      
    <p>
      The information in your credit report is used to calculate your
      FICO score, a number generally between 300 and 850. The acronym 
      stands for Fair, Isaac and Company. The higher
      your score, the less risk you pose to creditors. A high score, for
      example, makes it easier for you to obtain a loan, rent an
      apartment, or lower your insurance rate. Your FICO score is
      available from
      <a href="http://www.myfico.com">www.myfico.com</a>for a fee. Free
      credit reports do not contain your credit score, although you can
      purchase it when you request your free annual credit report
      through
      <a href="http://www.annualcreditreport.com">www.annualcreditreport.com</a>.
    </p>
    </section>
      <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Tips for Building a Better Credit Score</h2>
    
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Pay your bills on time. Delinquent payments and collections
          negatively affect your score.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Keep balances low on credit cards and other “revolving
          credit.” High outstanding debt lowers your score.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Apply for and open new credit accounts only as needed. Don’t
          open an account just to have a better credit mix; it probably
          won’t raise your score.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Pay off debt instead of moving it around. Owing the same
          amount, but having fewer open accounts, may lower your score.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      You don’t rebuild your credit score; you rebuild your credit
      history. Time is your ally in improving credit. There is no “quick
      fix” for a bad credit score, so be suspicious of any deals that
      offer you a fast, easy solution.
    </p>
      </section>
      <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Negative Information in Your Credit Report</h2>
    
    <p>
      Negative information concerning your use of credit can be kept in
      your credit report for seven years. A bankruptcy can be kept for
      10 years, and unpaid tax liens for 15 years. Information about a
      lawsuit or an unpaid judgment against you can be reported for
      seven years or until the statute of limitations runs out,
      whichever is longer. Inquiries remain on your report for two
      years.
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Debt Collection E-mails</h5>
      
    <p>
      When communicating with consumers through email, debt collectors
      must observe the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). It is
      important for you and creditors or collection agencies to save and
      store copies of all communication, which will be important if
      there is a disagreement later.
    </p>
    <p>
      To take steps towards maintaining privacy, conduct all communications 
      via email using either secure email platforms or industry-specific 
      communication platforms. Never give a workplace email account as 
      a contact address, as there is no legal expectation of privacy 
      for a workplace email account.</p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      Anyone who denies you credit, housing, insurance, or a job as a
      result of a credit report must give you the name, address, and
      telephone number of the CRA that provided the report. Under the
      Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), you have the right to request a
      free report within 60 days if a company denies you credit based on
      the report.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is inaccurate or incomplete information in your credit
      report:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Contact the CRA and the company that provided the information.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Tell the CRA in writing what information you believe is
          inaccurate. Keep a copy of all correspondence.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      Under the FCRA, the information provider is required to
      investigate and report the results to the CRA. If the information
      is found to be incorrect, FCRA must notify all nationwide CRAs to
      correct your file. If the investigation does not solve your
      dispute, ask that your statement concerning the dispute be 
      included in your file. A notice of your dispute must be included 
      whenever the CRA reports the negative item.
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Lost and Stolen Credit Cards</h5>
      
    <p>
      Immediately call the card issuer when you suspect a credit or
      charge card has been lost or stolen. Once you report the loss or
      theft of a card, you have no further responsibility for
      unauthorized charges. In any event, your maximum liability under
      federal law is $50 per card.
    </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      If the information is accurate, only time, hard work, and a
      personal debt repayment plan will improve your credit report.
      Credit repair companies advertise that they can erase bad credit
      for a hefty fee. Don’t believe it. Under the Credit Repair
      Organizations Act, credit repair companies can’t require you to
      pay until they have completed promised services. They must also
      give you:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          A copy of the “Consumer Credit File Rights Under State and
          Federal Law” before you sign a contract
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          A written contract that spells out your rights and obligations
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Three days to cancel without paying any fees
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      Some credit
      repair companies promise to help you establish a whole new
      credit identity. You can be charged with fraud if you use the
      mail or telephone to apply for credit with false information.
      It is also a federal crime to make false statements on a loan
      or credit application, to give a false Social Security number,
      or to obtain an Employer Identification Number from the
      Internal Revenue Service under false pretenses. If you have
      lost money to a credit repair scam, contact your state or local
      consumer affairs office (p. 112).

    <section id="dealing_with_debt" data-type="sect1"><h1>Dealing with Debt</h1>
      
    <p>
      If you want to reduce your amount of debt, you can do some work on
      your own. First, develop a realistic budget so you can see your
      income and expenses in one place and look for ways to save money.
      For help in creating a budget, visit
      <a href="http://www.mymoney.gov">www.mymoney.gov</a> or

      Also, contact your creditors and inform them that you are having
      difficulty making payments; they may be able to modify your
      payment plan.
    </p>
    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Debt Collection</h2>
      
    <p>
      The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act applies to those who
      collect debts owed to creditors for personal, family, and
      household expenditures. These debts include car loans, mortgages,
      charge accounts, and money owed for medical bills. A debt
      collector is someone hired to collect money you owe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within five days after a debt collector first contacts you, the
      collector must send you a notice that tells you the name of the
      creditor, how much you owe, and what action to take if you believe
      you don’t owe the money. If you owe the money or part of it,
      contact the creditor to arrange for payment. If you believe you
      don’t owe the money, contact the creditor in writing and send a
      copy to the collection agency with a letter telling it not to
      contact you.
    </p>
    <p>
      A debt collector may not:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Contact you at unreasonable times, for example, before 8 am or
          after 9 pm, unless you agree
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Contact you at work if you tell the debt collector your
          employer disapproves
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Contact you after you write a letter telling the collector to
          stop, except to notify you if the collector or creditor plans
          to take a specific action
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Contact your friends, relatives, employer, or others, except
          to find out where you live and work
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Harass you with repeated telephone calls, profane language, or
          threats to harm you
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Make any false statement or claim you will be arrested
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Threaten to have money deducted from your paycheck or to sue
          you, unless the collection agency or creditor intends to do so
          and it is legal
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      To file a complaint about a debt collection company, contact your
      state or local consumer protection agency (p. 112) and the FTC (p. 107).

    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Credit Counseling Services</h2>
      
    <p>
      Counseling services are available to help people budget money and
      pay bills. Credit unions, extension offices, military family
      service centers, and religious organizations are among those that
      may offer free or low-cost credit counseling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Local, nonprofit agencies that provide educational programs on
      money management and help in developing debt payment plans operate
      under the name Consumer Credit Counseling Service (CCCS). Make
      certain that the agency is accredited by the Council on
      Accreditation (COA) or the International Organization for
      Standardization (ISO). The counselor should also be certified by
      the National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC), an
      organization that supports a national network of credit
      counselors.

      <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Peer-to-Peer Lending</h5>
        
    <p>
      Peer to peer lending (P2P), or social lending, is a new process of
      connecting an individual borrower with lenders, without using
      traditional banks to obtain an unsecured loan. As a potential
      borrower, you can post a request for a loan, along with a brief
      description of how you will use it. The borrower and lenders are
      strangers; their only knowledge of each other is through the P2P
      website. Although the idea seems very informal, a peer-to-peer
      loan contract is a formal, legally binding agreement between two
      parties; checks and pay stubs are required. There can still be
      fees for late and missed payments. The lenders must report your
      loan payment history to the credit reporting agencies. For more
      information about peer-to-peer lending, visit
      <a href="http://www.consumeraction.org/news/articles/2012_p2p_lending_survey/#primer">www.consumeraction.org/news/articles/2012_p2p_lending_survey/#primer</a>.

          Typically, a counseling service will negotiate lower payments with
          your creditors, and then make the payments using money you send to
          it each month. The cost of setting up this debt-management plan is
          paid by the creditor, not you. Ask these questions to find the best
          counselor for you:
        </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          What services do you offer? Look for an organization that
          offers budget counseling and money management classes as well
          as debt-management planning.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Do you offer free information? Avoid organizations that charge
          for information or make you provide a lot of details about
          your problem first.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          What are your fees? Are there set-up and/or monthly fees? A
          typical set-up fee is $10. Beware of agencies that charge
          large up-front fees.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          How will the debt-management plan work? What debts can be
          included in the plan, and will you get regular reports on your
          accounts?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask whether the counselor can get creditors to lower or
          eliminate interest and fees. If the answer is yes, contact
          your creditors to verify this.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask what happens if you can’t afford to pay. If an
          organization won’t help you because you can’t afford to pay,
          go somewhere else for help.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Will your counselor help you avoid future problems? Getting a
          plan for avoiding future debt is as important as solving the
          immediate debt problem.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask for a contract. All verbal promises should be in writing
          before you pay any money.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Are your counselors accredited or certified? Legitimate credit
          counseling firms are affiliated with the NFCC (p. 145) or the 
          Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies 
          (p. 143). 
        </p>
      </li></ul>

      Check with your local consumer protection agency

    <p>
      Bankruptcy generally is considered the debt management option of

      The Bankruptcy Abuse and Prevention Act of 2005 established more
      stringent rules for consumers and attorneys.

    <p>
      The filing process may be difficult for debtors:

      <ul><li>
      <p>
      Debtors must file documents, including itemized statements of
      monthly net income, proof of income (pay stubs) for the last 60
      days, and tax returns for the preceding year (four years for
      Chapter 13 bankruptcies).
    </p>
    </li><li>

      unsecured loans, don’t use property as collateral. Lenders
      consider these as more risky than secured loans, so they charge a
      higher interest rate for them. Most credit cards are unsecured
      loans, although some consumers have secured credit cards. Two very
      common secured loans are home equity and installment loans.
    </p>
    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Home Equity Loans</h2>
      
    <p>
      A home equity loan is a form of credit where your home is used as
      collateral for the loan. This type of loan is often used to pay
      for major expenses, such as education, medical bills, and home
      repairs. Consider carefully before taking out a home equity loan.
      If you are unable to make payments on time, you could lose your
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Home equity loans can be either a revolving line of credit or a
      lump sum. Revolving credit lets you withdraw funds when you need
      them. A lump sum is a one-time, closed-end loan for a particular
      purpose, such as remodeling or tuition. Apply for a home equity
      loan through a bank or credit union first. These loans are likely
      to cost less than those offered by finance companies.

    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Installment Loans</h2>
      
      <p>
        Installment loans are loans that are repaid over time with
        a set number of scheduled payments; the most common
        installment loans are home or car loans. Before you sign
        an agreement for a loan to buy a house, a car, or other
        large purchase, make sure you fully understand all of the
        lender’s terms and conditions, including:
      </p>
      <ul><li>
          <p>
           The dollar amount you are borrowing
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            The payment amounts and when they are due
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            The total finance charge, including all interest and fees
            you must pay to get the loan
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            The APR, the rate of interest you will pay over the full

          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Penalties for late payments

          <p>
            Penalties if you pay the loan back early
          </p>
        </li></ul>

          The Truth in Lending Act requires lenders to give you this
          information so you can compare different offers.

      <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Payday and Tax Refund Loans</h5>
        
        <p>
          Payday loans are designed to stretch your budget until
          your payday. Beware; these loans charge high annual
          interest rates and excessive fees that are due every few
          weeks. Because of these excessive fees, payday loans
          are illegal in some states and for all members of the
          military. With a typical payday loan, you might write a
          personal check for $115 to borrow $100 for two weeks,
          until payday. The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) in this
          example is 390%! If you can repay the loan quickly, it
          may not appear to be such a bad deal. But if you have to
          renew the loan, that relatively small loan can grow into a
          major debt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another high-cost way to borrow money is a tax refund
          loan. This type of credit lets you get an advance on a
          tax refund—for a fee. APRs as high as 774% have been
          reported. If you’re short of cash, avoid both of these
          loans by asking for more time to pay a bill or seeking a
          traditional short-term bank loan.

        Many state governments have created 529 plans that
        make it easier for families to save for their child’s
        education. These plans, which can be sponsored by
        states or institutions of higher learning, encourage saving
        for future college costs, and the earnings grow tax-free.
        There are two main types: “pre-paid tuition plans” and
        “college savings plans.” Pre-paid plans allow you to pay
        for your child’s college tuition based on today’s costs,
        and then pay out at the future (higher) cost once your
        child is in college. College savings plans allow you to
        invest money in several investment funds, ranging in risk
        level, to pay for your child’s college education. For more

        <p>
          Scholarships and financial aid do not require up-front
          fees. While there are legitimate companies that will
          help guide you through the financial aid and college
          application process for a fee, disreputable companies
          may ask you for money up front and provide nothing in
          return. Red flags to watch out for include the following:
        </p>
        <ul><li>
            <p>
              A “money-back guarantee” to secure a scholarship.
              Don’t believe it. Unscrupulous companies attach
              conditions that make it impossible to get the refund.
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              “Secret scholarships.” If a company claims to have
              inside knowledge of scholarship money, it’s lying.
              Information on scholarships is freely available to the
              public. Ask your librarian or school counselor.
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              Telling students they’ve been selected as “finalists”
              for awards.
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              Asking for a student’s checking account to “confirm
              eligibility.” If a company wants bank account
              information or your credit card number to confirm or
              reserve a scholarship, it’s a scam.
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              Quoting a relatively small “monthly” or “weekly” fee,
              then asking for authorization to debit your checking
              account for an unspecified length of time. Ongoing
              fees are a sure sign of a scam.

      <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Defaulting on Student Loans</h2>
        
      <p>
        You can take steps to avoid defaulting on your student
        loan. Before you get the loan, determine how much
        money you need to borrow and only borrow that amount.
        When you get the loan, make certain that you understand
        the details such as the payment terms and what type of
        loan you have. Once your student loan becomes due:
      </p>
      <ul><li>
        <p>
        Maintain accurate records of your loan, including the
        loan agreement, interest rates, and account numbers.
        </p>
        </li><li>
        <p>
        Track your loans to stay updated on how much you
        owe.
        </p>
        </li><li>
        <p>
        Make certain that the loan servicer has your current
        contact information and bank account (if payments are
        withdrawn automatically).
        </p>
        </li></ul>
        <p>
        If you default, it means you failed to make payments on
        your student loan as scheduled. Your loan becomes
        delinquent the first day after you miss a payment.
        However, the loan isn’t in default until 270 days have
        passed without a payment. The consequences of default
        can be severe, including:
        </p>
        <ul><li>
        <p>
        The entire unpaid balance of your loan and any interest
        is immediately due and payable.
        </p>
        </li><li>
        <p>
        Your loan account is assigned to a collection agency.
        </p>
        </li><li>
        <p>
        The loan will be reported as delinquent to credit
        bureaus, damaging your credit.
        </p>
        </li><li>
        <p>
        Your federal and state taxes may be withheld through
        a tax offset. This means that the Internal Revenue 
        Service can take your federal and state tax refund to
        collect any of your defaulted student loan debt.
        </p>
        </li><li>
        <p>
          Your employer can withhold money from your pay and
          send the money to the government. This process is
          called wage garnishment.
        </p>
        </li></ul>
        <p>
          If you are having difficulty making your payments, contact
          your loan servicer immediately. The servicer may be
          able to help by changing your repayment plan, switching
          the due date, getting a deferment or forbearance, or
          consolidating your student loans.
        </p>

    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Work-at-Home Companies</h1>
      
    <p>
      Not all work-at-home opportunities deliver on their promises. Some
      classic work-at-home schemes are medical billing, envelope
      stuffing, and assembly or craftwork. Ads for these businesses say,
      “Be part of one of America’s Fastest-Growing Industries. Earn
      thousands of dollars a month from your home!” Legitimate
      work-at-home program sponsors should tell you, in writing, what’s
      involved in the program they are selling. Here are some questions
      you might ask a promoter:
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Credit Checks: A New Part of the Hiring Process</h5>
      
    <p>
      Are you in the market for a new job? If so, remember that
      potential employers aren’t just reading your résumé; they are also
      reviewing your credit history. Before you apply for any job, get
      your free credit report (see p. 12) for information about your
      credit history, including:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          If you pay your bills on time or late
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          How much money you owe
        </p>

        <p>
          If someone has sued you
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      Before a potential employer can request your credit report or use
      it, the company must notify you and ask your permission. And if a
      company decides not to hire you because of information in your
      credit report, it must tell you (orally or in writing), along with
      information about the credit reporting company and your rights to
      dispute the accuracy of the report. For more information about
      what to know when looking for a job, visit

          What is the total cost of the work-at-home program, including

          my money?
        </p>
      </li></ul>

    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Multilevel Marketing</h2>
      
    <p>
      Some multilevel marketing plans are legitimate; however, others
      are illegal pyramid schemes. In pyramids, commissions are based on
      the number of distributors recruited. Most of the product sales
      are made to these distributors, not to consumers in general. The
      underlying goods and services, which vary from vitamins to car
      leases, only make the schemes look legitimate. Most people end up
      with nothing to show for their money except the expensive products
      or marketing materials they were pressured to buy for resale.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re thinking about joining what appears to be a legitimate
      multilevel marketing plan, take time to learn about the plan:

          What products does it sell?

          Does it sell products to the public at large?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Does it have the evidence to back up the claims it makes about
          its product?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Is the product competitively priced?

    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Net-Based Business Opportunities</h2>
      
    <p>
      The FTC says that many Internet business opportunities are scams
      that promise more than they can possibly deliver. These companies
      lure would-be entrepreneurs with false promises of big earnings
      for little effort. Some tips for finding a legitimate opportunity:
    </p>
      <ul><li>
    <p>
      Consider the promotion carefully.
    </p>
      </li><li>
    <p>
      Study the business opportunity’s franchise disclosure document.
    </p>
        </li><li>
    <p>
      Get earnings claims in writing and compare them with the
      experience of previous franchise and business opportunity owners.
    </p>
        </li><li>
    <p>
      Visit previous franchise and business opportunity owners in
      person, preferably at their places of business.
    </p>
        </li><li>
        <p>
          Check out the company with the local consumer protection
          agency (p. 112) and Better Business Bureau (p. 67) to see 
          whether there have been any complaints.
        </p>
        </li><li>
    <p>
      If the business opportunity involves selling products from
      well-known companies, verify the relationship with the legal
      department of the company whose merchandise you would promote.
    </p>
        </li><li>
    <p>
      Consult an attorney, accountant, or other business advisor before
      you put any money down or sign any papers.
    </p>
        </li><li>
    <p>
      Take your time. Promoters of fraudulent business opportunities are
      likely to use high-pressure sales tactics to get you to buy in. If
      the business opportunity is legitimate, it will still be around
      when you’re ready to decide.

      <p>
        It can be a challenge to make healthy food choices and
        stay within your food budget. Here are some tips to help
        you get the most from your grocery budget:
      </p>
      <ul><li>
          <p>
            Take an inventory of the food you already have in your
            home. Plan your meals for the week, keeping in mind
            what you already have.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Make a shopping list and stick to it.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Compare unit prices (cost per ounce or pound) to get
            the best deal.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Buy the generic store brand versions of foods.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Take advantage of store loyalty savings programs
            as well as clipping coupons and online discounts.
            Remember that stores retain your purchase habits and
            use them for marketing purposes. See Protecting Your
            Privacy (p. 38) for more information.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Only take advantage of the deal if you know you will eat
            the discounted item. It’s not a deal if the food goes to
            waste.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Shop the perimeter of the store for nutrient-dense
            foods. Processed and packaged foods tend to be more
            expensive.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Visit your local farmer’s market to find fresh produce.
            Arrive early to get the best selection or late to get the
            best deals. Fresh food spoils quickly, so don’t buy more
            than you can eat or freeze. Find your local farmers

          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Shop for foods that are in season. When the supply is
            plentiful, the prices tend to be lower.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>

    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Organic Foods</h1>
      
    <p>
      Buying organic food is a way to eat in a healthy manner and
      protect the environment. These foods are grown and processed
      according to USDA regulations and follow specific rules concerning
      pest control, raising animals, and the use of additives. Keep in
      mind that organic and natural foods tend to be more expensive than
      conventionally grown foods, and that the USDA does not claim that
      organic food is safer or more nutritious than other foods.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make sure a product is certified organic, look for the USDA
      organic seal. You can also tell whether produce was grown
      organically by checking the price look up code (PLU); if the first
      number starts with a 4, then the food was grown conventionally, if
      it starts with a 9, it was grown organically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other common labels that help you choose certain types of food 
      products include:
     </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Free-Range or
      Cage-Free</strong>. The flock was provided shelter in a
      building, room, or area with unlimited access to food, fresh
      water, and the outdoors during its production cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Natural</strong>. As required by USDA,
      meat, poultry, and egg products labeled as “natural” must be
      minimally processed and contain no artificial ingredients.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Grass-Fed</strong>. Grass-fed animals
      receive a majority of their nutrients from grass throughout their
      life, while organic animals’ pasture diet may be supplemented with
      grain.

      “Going Green” means practicing an environmentally friendly and
      ecologically responsible lifestyle as well as making decisions to
      help protect the environment and sustain natural resources. There
      are lots of reasons to consider going green—too much trash,
      greenhouse gases, air and water pollution, damage to the ozone
      layer, and saving money. For example, switching all of the light
      bulbs in a home from conventional incandescent light bulbs to
      compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs could save about $40 over
      the life of the bulb. Other examples include:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Turn your thermostat down two degrees in winter and up two
          degrees in summer.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Make sure your walls and ceilings are well insulated.

      <p>
        The number of products claiming they are “eco-friendly”
        or “all-natural” has increased due to a growing demand
        for “green” products. You may be unsure about which
        environmental standards and labels can be trusted. You
        can use the FTC’s Green Guides (<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/grnrule/guides980427"/>) 
        as a resource to verify that the
        environmental attributes or products are truthful. Here are
        some tips to help you sort through eco-label marketing:
      </p>
      <ul><li>
          <p>
      Look for specific (for example, “contains 75% postconsumer
      recycled materials”) rather than vague
      statements about environmental impact.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Determine whether the green marketing claims apply to
            the packaging, the product, or both.            
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
      Beware of fake third-party certification. Visit Consumer
      Reports’ website (<a href="http://www.greenerchoices.org/eco-labels">www.greenerchoices.org/eco-labels</a>)
      to find reliable environmental labels.
          </p>
          <p>
            For more information about environmental advertising and
            labeling, contact the FTC (p. 107) or EPA (p. 105).

    <p>
      When searching for a primary care doctor, dentist, specialist, or
      other health care professional:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Find out whether the health care professional is licensed in
          your state. A state or local occupational and professional
          licensing board will be able to give you this information.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Research whether the health care professional is
          board-certified in the appropriate specialty. Visit 
          <a href="http:ama-assn.org">www.ama-assn.org</a> and

          information.
        </p>
      </li><li>
    <p>
      Ask how often the health care professional has done the procedure
      you need or has treated your condition. You may be able to find
      some of this information on the Internet. For example, the Centers
      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports the success rates
      and number of procedures performed by fertility clinics at
      <a href="http://www.cdc.gov">www.cdc.gov</a>. Some states also
      collect and post data on the success of heart-bypass surgery.
    </p>
    </li><li>
    <p>
      Check whether there have been any complaints or disciplinary
      actions taken against the provider you are researching. Visit

      for more advice on identifying providers.
    </p>
    </li><li>
        <p>
          Find out what doctors participate in your health insurance
          plan. If you are having surgery, check that all providers
          (radiologists, anesthesiologists) are also covered by your
          plan, to avoid surprise bills.
        </p>
      </li></ul>

          and his or her practice:
        </p>
    <ul><li>
    <p>
      Does the doctor participate in your insurance plan?
    </p>
      </li><li>
    <p>
      Is the office in an area that you can get to easily or does it
      have hours during times when you can make an appointment?
    </p>
      </li><li>
    <p>
      Does the doctor have privileges at the hospital you prefer?
    </p>
      </li><li>
    <p>
      Do you get along well with the doctor? Do you feel that you
      communicate well with each other and that he or she listens to
      your concerns and explains diagnoses and benefits of new
      treatments and prescriptions clearly?
    </p>
      </li><li>
    <p>
      What is the doctor’s cancelation policy?
    </p>
      </li><li>
    <p>
      Will you have to pay for the visit if you cancel your appointment?

          by other health care professionals. It’s important that 
          you are proactive and communicate honestly with 
          your pharmacist. Topics you should discuss with your 
          pharmacist include:
        </p>
        <ul><li>
            <p>
              What other medications you take
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              Whether you have allergic reactions to any medications
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              Whether there is a generic version of the medication 
              you can take instead
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              Any questions about the medication you are receiving
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              Whether there is a risk that your medications don’t mix 
              well with each other
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>

      <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Where To Go For Medical Care</h5>
        
    <p>
      When you are sick, you may not know the best place to go for
      medical care. In non-emergency situations, your first choice
      should be your primary care provider (PCP). Your PCP knows your
      medical history and treats common ailments. Urgent care is best
      when you need medical attention for a non-life threatening illness
      quickly or after regular hours. Go to the emergency room if your
      illness is serious or life-threatening, such as:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Choking
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Stopped breathing
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Head injury with passing out, fainting, or confusion
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Injury to neck or spine, especially if there is loss of
          feeling or inability to move
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Electric shock or lightning strike
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Severe burn
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Seizure that lasts three to five minutes
        </p>

      Remember to finish your entire prescription, since some illnesses
      require treatment to continue past the time when symptoms go away.
      Make certain that your pharmacy has your current health and
      prescription insurance on record so you get the best price
      possible. If you have difficulty paying for your medications,
      contact the manufacturer; some pharmaceutical companies have
      patient assistance programs to help you afford your medication.
    </p>
    <p>
      An increasing number of consumers are replacing a trip to the
      pharmacy with a visit to the Internet. While there are online
      pharmacies that provide legitimate prescription services, there
      are also some questionable sites that make buying medicines online
      risky. Do business only with a licensed U.S. pharmacy. Check with
      the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy to determine
      whether the site is licensed and in good standing. Visit
      <a href="http://www.nabp.net">www.nabp.net</a> or call
      847-391-4406.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you suspect a site is not a licensed pharmacy, report it and
      any complaints to the Food and Drug Administration (p. 100) at

      <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage</h1>
        
    <p>
      Medicare offers prescription drug coverage to help senior citizens
      and others who need medical assistance get the prescription drugs
      they need, under Part D of the program (or Part C if you are
      enrolled in the Medicare Advantage Plan). Everyone with Medicare
      can join a drug plan to get this coverage. Not all Medicare drug
      plans are the same, however. If you aren’t sure whether a drug
      plan is approved by Medicare, call 1-800-MEDICARE (6334227). Look
      for the “Medicare Approved” seal on drug discount cards to make
      sure you are getting the best deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medicare prescription drug coverage pays expenses up to $2,800;
      once your prescription costs exceeds that amount, you will no
      longer have coverage and will be responsible for the full cost of
      your drugs. However, once your out-of-pocket spending reaches
      $4,550, your prescription coverage will kick back in. Any amount
      of prescription drug spending between $2,800 and $4,550 is called
      the coverage gap or “Medicare donut hole.” Beginning in 2013, if
      you reach the coverage gap, you will automatically get a 52.5%
      discount on covered brand-name drugs and a 14% discount on generic
      drugs. If you have limited income and resources, you may get extra
      help to cover prescription drugs for little or no cost. For more
      information, contact the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid
      Services (p. 100).

    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Advance Medical Directives</h1>
      
    <p>
      We all face the possibility that we may become incapacitated
      sometime during our lifetime. This often happens when nearing
      death, but it can also be the result of a temporary condition.
      Many people assume their spouses or children will automatically be
      allowed to make financial and/or medical decisions for them, but
      this is not necessarily true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advance directives are written documents that tell your doctors
      what kind of treatment you want if you become unable to make
      medical decisions (for example, if you’re in a coma). Forms and
      laws vary from state to state, so it’s a good idea to understand
      the laws of the state where you live when you write advance
      directives. It’s also a good idea to make them before you are very
      ill. Federal law requires hospitals, nursing homes, and other
      institutions that receive Medicare or Medicaid funds to provide
      written information regarding advance medical directives to all
      patients upon admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      A living will is one type of advance directive that goes into
      effect when a person is terminally ill. A living will does not
      give you the opportunity to select someone to make decisions for
      you, but it does allow you to specify the kind of treatment you
      want in specific situations. For example, you might choose to
      specify that you do not want to be treated with antibiotics if
      death is imminent. You can, if you choose, include an advance
      directive that you do not wish to be resuscitated if your heart
      stops or if you stop breathing. In this case, a Do Not Resuscitate
      (DNR) order would be entered on your medical chart.
    </p>
    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Naming a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care</h2>
      
    <p>
      A durable power of attorney for health care (sometimes called a
      durable medical power of attorney) specifies the person you’ve
      chosen to make medical decisions for you. It is activated when
      you’re unconscious or unable to make medical decisions, or when
      you have specified. You need to choose someone who meets the legal
      requirements in your state for acting as your agent. State laws
      vary, but most states disqualify anyone under the age of 18, your
      health care provider, or employees of your health care provider.
    </p>
    <p>
      The person you choose as your agent must:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Be willing to speak and advocate on your behalf
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Be willing to deal with conflict among friends and family

    <p>
      When choosing among housing options, there are many decisions you
      must make. Should you rent or buy? If you buy, what sort of
      financing should you choose, and what type of mortgages is best
      for you? The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
      (HUD) funds housing counseling agencies throughout the country to
      help you make these decisions. These organizations can give you
      advice on buying a home, renting, defaults, foreclosures, credit
      issues, and reverse mortgages. To contact the agency nearest you,
      call 1-800-569-4287 or visit
      <a href="http://www.hud.gov">www.hud.gov</a>. Homeowners with
      problems that could result in default on their mortgage or
      foreclosure on their property are encouraged to contact a
      HUD-approved housing counseling agency immediately.

      If you believe you are being discriminated against during your
      housing search because of your race, color, nationality, religion,

      Housing and Equal Opportunity (p. 102).

    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Buying A Home</h1>
      
    <p>
      Buying a home is one of the most complex financial decisions
      you’ll ever make. In addition to the financial and legal issues
      involved, real estate agents and lenders may not be acting in your
      best interest.
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Real estate agents represent the seller, not the buyer.
          Consider hiring a buyer’s agent who works for you, not for the
          seller.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get prices on other homes. Knowing the price of other homes in
          a neighborhood will help you avoid paying too much.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Have the property inspected. Use a licensed home inspector to
          inspect the property carefully before you agree to buy it.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Check to see if a particular home requires you to pay any
          ongoing homeowners association or condo fees.

    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Mortgages</h2>
      
    <p>
      When shopping for a home mortgage, make sure you obtain all of the
      relevant information:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Research current interest rates. Check the real estate section
          of your local newspaper, use the Internet, or call at least
          six lenders for information.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Check the rates for 15-year, 20-year, and 30-year mortgages.
          You may be able to save thousands of dollars in interest
          charges by getting the shortest-term mortgage you can afford.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask for details on the same loan amount, loan term, and type
          of loan from multiple lenders so you can compare the
          information. Be sure to get the APR, which takes into account
          not only the interest rate, but also points, broker fees, and
          other credit charges expressed as a yearly rate.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask whether the rate is fixed or adjustable. The interest rate
          on adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) can vary a great deal over
          the lifetime of the mortgage. An increase of several percentage 
          points might raise payments by hundreds of dollars per month.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Underwater/Upside-down Mortgages</h5>
      
    <p>
      When describing a mortgage in trouble, the terms “underwater” or
      “upside-down” mean the same thing— when the amount of money you
      still have to pay on the loan is more than the actual value of the
      loan. For more information about underwater or upside-down
      mortgages, visit 
      <a href="http://www.makinghomeaffordable.gov/programs/fallen-value-help">www.makinghomeaffordable.gov/programs/fallen-value-help</a>.
    </p>
    </aside>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          If a loan has an adjustable rate, ask when and how the rate
          and loan payment can change.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Find out how much of a down payment is required. Some lenders
          require 20% of the home’s purchase price as a down payment.
          But many lenders now offer loans that require less. In these
          cases, you may be required to purchase private mortgage
          insurance (PMI) to protect the lender if you fall behind on
          payments.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          If PMI is required, ask what the total cost of the insurance
          will be. How much will the monthly mortgage payment be when
          the PMI premium is added, and how long you will be required to
          carry PMI?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask whether you can pay off the loan early, and whether there 
          is a penalty for doing so. 
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
     There is a long list of sources
      for mortgage loans: mortgage banks, mortgage brokers, banks,
      thrifts and credit unions, home builders, real estate agencies,

    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Mortgage Transfers</h2>
      
    <p>
      CFPB rules help mortgage borrowers by requiring that mortgage
      companies notify them when their loans are transferred to another
      company. The rules ensure that you know who owns your loan, which
      is important information if you have questions or payment disputes
      or want to discuss loan modifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these rules, the company that takes over your loan must send
      you a notice within 30 days of acquiring it. Even with a new loan
      owner, the company that “services” or handles your loan might not
      change, and you might continue to send your mortgage payments to
      the same address. If that loan servicer changes, you will receive
      a separate notice.

    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Avoiding Foreclosure</h1>
      
    <p>
      If you miss your mortgage payments, foreclosure may occur. This is
      the legal means your lender can use to repossess your home. If you
      owe more than your property is worth, a deficiency judgment is
      pursued. Both foreclosures and deficiency judgments have a
      negative impact on your future credit. You should avoid
      foreclosure if at all possible.

    <p>
      Consider refinancing your mortgage if you can get a rate that is
      at least one percentage point lower than your existing mortgage
      rate and if you plan to keep the new mortgage for several years.
      When comparing mortgages, don’t forget to include the extra fees
      you must pay for the new mortgage. You may be able to get some
      fees waived if you are able to refinance with your current
      mortgage holder.

          Loss Mitigation Department immediately. Explain your
          situation. Be prepared to provide financial information, such
          as your monthly income and expenses. Without this information,
          the lender may not be able to help you.

    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Moving Companies</h1>
      
    <p>
      Not all moving companies are the same. Although many are
      legitimate, some attempt to take advantage of their clients.
      Follow these guidelines to help you choose the right mover:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Get a written estimate from several
      movers.</strong> Be wary of very low estimates. Some companies
      quote a low price to get a contract and later ask for more money
      before they will remove your belongings from their truck.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Make sure the mover has an operating license.</strong> 
      For moves from one state to another, visit
      <a href="http://www.protectyourmove.gov">www.protectyourmove.gov</a>
      to verify a mover’s license. For moves within a state, check your
      state, county, or local consumer affairs agency (p. 112).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Make sure the mover has
      insurance.</strong> If furniture is damaged during the move, the
      mover’s insurance should cover it. Ask how to file a complaint if
      there are limits to the coverage. For more information about the
      levels of mover’s insurance coverage, visit <a href="http://www.protectyourmove.gov/consumer/awareness/valuation/valuation-insurance.htm">www.protectyourmove.gov/consumer/awareness/valuation/valuation-insurance.htm</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Check
      the mover’s record.</strong> Contact your state or local
      consumer protection agency (p. 112) or the Better Business Bureau
      (p. 67) to see whether there is a history of complaints.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a dispute with a moving company, you can file a
      complaint with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration by
      calling 1-888-368-7238 or by visiting
      <a href="http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov">www.fmcsa.dot.gov</a>.

    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Home Improvement And Repairs</h1>
      
    <p>
      Home improvements and repairs can cost thousands of dollars and
      are the subject of frequent complaints. When selecting a
      contractor:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Get recommendations and references. Talk to friends, family,
          and others who have used the contractor for similar work.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get at least three written estimates. Insist the contractors
          come to your home to evaluate what needs to be done. Be sure
          the estimates are based on the same work so you can make
          meaningful comparisons.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Check contractor complaint records with your state or local
          consumer protection agency (p. 112) or the Better Business
          Bureau (p. 67).
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Make sure the contractor meets licensing and registration
          requirements. Your state or local consumer protection agency
          (p. 112) can help you determine the necessary requirements.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get the names of suppliers and ask them whether the contractor
          makes timely payments.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Contact your local building inspection department to check for
          permit and inspection requirements. Be wary if the contractor
          asks you to get the permit; it could mean the firm is not
          licensed.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Be sure your contractor is insured. The contractor should have
          personal liability, property damage, and workers’ compensation
          insurance for workers and subcontractors. Also check with your
          insurance company to find out whether you are covered for any
          injury or damage that might occur.

    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>﻿Beware: Foreclosure Rescue Scams</h5>
      
      <p>
        Scam artists often target homeowners who are struggling to meet 
        their mortgage commitment or are anxious to sell their homes. 
        Recognize and avoid common scams:
      </p>
      <ul><li>
          <p>
            <em>Lease-back or rent-to-buy scams:</em> 
            You are asked to transfer 
            the title to your home “temporarily” to the scam artist who 
            promises to obtain better financing for your mortgage and 
            allow you to stay in your home as a renter with the option 
            to purchase the home back. However, if you do not comply 
            with the terms of the rent-to-buy agreement, you will lose 
            your money and be evicted like any other tenant.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            <em>Fake “government” modification programs:</em> 
            These scams claim to be affiliated with the government or 
            require that you pay high fees to benefit from government 
            modification programs. Remember that you do not have to pay 
            any fees to participate in government-approved programs. Some 
            frauds may even use words like “Federal” or “government-approved” 
            or acquire website names that make consumers think they are 
            associated with the government.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            <em>Refinance fraud:</em> The scam 
            artist offers to be an intermediary between you and your 
            mortgage lender to negotiate a loan modification. The scam 
            artist may even instruct you to make payments directly to 
            him or her, which the scammer will send to the lender. 
            However, the scam artist will not forward the payments 
            to your lender and you could still lose your home.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            <em>“Eliminate your debt” claims:</em> 
            Some companies may make false legal claims that you are 
            not required to repay your mortgage or that they know 
            of “secret laws” that can eliminate your debt. Do not 
            believe these claims.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            <em>Refinance scams:</em> You 
            are encouraged to sign “foreclosure rescue” loan documents 
            to refinance your loan. In reality, you have surrendered 
            ownership of your home because the loan documents are 
            actually deed transfer documents. You may falsely believe 
            that your home has been saved from foreclosure until you 
            receive an eviction notice months or even years later.
          </p>

    </aside>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Insist on a written contract that states exactly what work
          will be done, the quality of materials that will be used,
          warranties, timetables, the names of any subcontractors, the
          total price of the job, and the schedule of payments.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Try to limit your down payment. Some states have laws limiting
          the amount of down payment required.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Understand your payment options. Compare the cost of getting
          your own loan versus contractor financing.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Don’t make a final payment or sign a final release until you
          are satisfied with the work and know that subcontractors and
          suppliers have been paid. Some state laws allow unpaid
          subcontractors and suppliers to put a lien on your home for
          bills the contractor failed to pay.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Pay by credit card when you can. You may have the right to
          withhold payment to the credit card company until problems are
          corrected (see p. 13).
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Be especially cautious if the contractor:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Comes door-to-door or seeks you out
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Just happens to have material left over from a recent job
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Offers you discounts for finding other customers
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Quotes a price that’s out of line with other estimates
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Pressures you for an immediate decision
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Can only be reached by leaving messages with an answering
          service
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Asks you to pay for the entire job up front
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      With most home
      improvements, federal law gives you three business days to cancel
      without penalty. See the 3-Day Cooling-Off Rule (p. 4). Of course,
      you would be liable for any benefit already received. State laws
      may also provide some protection. And remember, if you finance
      home improvements with a home equity loan (p. 16) and don’t make
      your payments, you could lose your home.

      <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Renting/Leasing</h1>
    
    <p>
      A lease is an agreement that outlines the obligations of the owner
      and the tenants of a house or apartment. It is a legally binding
      document that courts will generally uphold in legal proceedings,
      so it is important for you to know the exact terms of the lease
      agreement before you sign it. Before agreeing to lease an
      apartment to you, a landlord may review your credit report, so you
      may want to get a copy before you start your apartment search.
      Some things to look for in a lease:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Clauses that allow the landlord to change the terms of the
          lease after it is signed
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Requirements/responsibilities of the tenants to do routine
          repairs such as lawn maintenance, cleaning, or notification
          about needed repairs
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Restrictions that would prevent you from living normally or
          comfortably in the home
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Terms of the lease and any important dates such as when the
          rent is due or garbage pickup days
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Extra fees for parking spaces or storage, garbage collection,
          and pets
        </p>
      </li><li>
    <p>
      Information regarding utility providers, how to arrange for
      service and whether the landlord or tenant is responsible for
      paying the bills (see Utilities, p. 52)
    </p>
    </li></ul>
    <p>
      Read the lease carefully and discuss anything you don’t understand
      or any issues you might have. All landlord responsibilities should
      be stated clearly. Always get a copy of the signed lease to keep
      in your records. Any clause or terms in the agreement affects ALL
      parties who sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Check with the Better Business Bureau (p. 67) or your local
      consumer protection office (p. 112) to determine if your
      prospective landlord has any existing complaints from previous
      tenants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fair Housing Act protects tenants who lease or rent property.
      If you think your rights have been violated, you may write a
      letter to or call the HUD office nearest you (p. 102). You have 
      one year after the alleged violation to file a
      complaint with HUD, but you should file as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>

      protections. For a state-by-state directory, visit

    <ol><li>
        <p>
            The best way to win over a prospective landlord is to be
            prepared by bringing a completed rental application with
            you; written references from previous landlords, employers,
            friends, and colleagues; and a current copy of your credit
            report.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Carefully review all of the important conditions of the
            tenancy before you sign.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            To avoid disputes or misunderstandings with your landlord,
            get everything in writing.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Ask about your privacy rights before you sign the lease.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Know your rights to live in a habitable rental unit— and
            don’t give them up.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Keep communication open with your landlord.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Purchase renters insurance to cover your valuables. See more
            information under Homeowners/Renters Insurance (p. 33).
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Make sure the security deposit refund procedures are spelled
            out in your lease or rental agreement.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Learn whether your building and neighborhood are safe, and
            what you can expect your landlord to do if they aren’t.
          </p>
        </li><li>
    <p>
      Know when to fight an eviction notice and when to move. Unless
      you have the law and provable facts on your side, fighting an
      eviction notice is usually shortsighted.

      any information concerning insurance companies and
      rates. This is a good way to get a feeling for the range of prices
      and the lowest-cost providers in your area.
    </p>
        </li><li>
        <p>
          Check several sources for the best deal. Try getting quotes
          online, but be aware that many online services may provide
          prices for just a few companies. An independent insurance
          agent who works with several insurers in your area may be able
          to get you a better deal.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Make sure the insurance company is licensed and covered by the
          state’s guaranty fund. The fund pays claims in case the
          company defaults. Your state insurance department (p. 130) can
          provide this information.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Check the financial stability and soundness of the insurance
          company. Ratings from A.M. Best
          (<a href="http:www.ambest.com"/>), Standard
          &amp; Poor’s (<a href="http:www.standardandpoors.com"/>),
          and Moody’s Investors Services
          (<a href="http://www.moodys.com"/>) are available online and at most
          public libraries.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Research the complaint record of the company. Contact your
          state insurance department (p. 130), or visit the website of
          the National Association of Insurance
          Commissioners (<a href="http:www.naic.org"/>),
          which has a database of complaints filed with state
          regulators.

    <p>
      Once you pay your first insurance premium, make sure you receive
      a written policy. This tells you that the agent forwarded your
      premium to the insurance company. If you don’t receive a policy
      within 60 days, contact your agent and the insurance company.

    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Auto Insurance</h1>
      
    <p>
      The requirements for auto insurance vary from state to state.
      Check with your state insurance regulator (p. 130) to learn more
      about individual requirements as well as insurers you may be
      considering for your policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get the best coverage at the best price, get several quotes
      from insurance companies; it may save you hundreds of dollars a
      year. Other ways to reduce your insurance premium include:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Raise your deductible on collision and comprehensive coverage.
          If you have an older car, you might want to drop this coverage
          altogether.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Take advantage of discounts. You may be eligible for a
          discount based on the number of miles you drive; your age
          (turning 25 or 50); your good grades if you are a student;
          your driving record (no moving vehicle violations or accidents
          in three years); or if you’ve taken a safe-driving course. You
          might also be able to get discounts if you insure more than
          one vehicle, insure your vehicle and your home with the same
          company, have anti-theft devices, or have safety features such
          as air bags or anti-lock brake system.

    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Disability Insurance</h1>
      
    <p>
      Disability can be more disastrous financially than death. If you
      are disabled, you lose your earning power, but you still have
      living expenses and often huge fees for medical care. Disability
      insurance helps you replace lost income. Many employers offer some
      type of disability insurance coverage for employees, or you can
      get an individual disability insurance policy. There are two types
      of disability policies: short-term disability (STD) and long-term
      disability (LTD). Short-term disability policies have a maximum
      benefit of two years, while long-term disability policies have
      benefits that can last the rest of your life. When purchasing
      disability insurance, ask:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>How is disability defined?</strong>
          Some policies consider you disabled if you are unable to
          perform the duties of any job. Better plans pay benefits if
          you are unable to do the usual duties of your own occupation.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>When do benefits begin?</strong>
          Most plans have a waiting period after an illness before
          payments begin.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Insurance Vocabulary</h5>
      
    <p>
      <strong>Claim</strong>—a request for your
      insurance provider to pay for services provided by a medical
      professional
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Co-payment (co-pay)</strong>—the amount,
      set by your insurer, that you pay when you receive medical service
      or for a prescription
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Deductible</strong>—amount you must pay
      before your insurance company will pay a claim. There are multiple
      types of deductibles, but in general, a lower deducible will have
      a higher-cost policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Explanation of benefits (EOB)</strong>—a

          <strong>What dollar amount is
          promised?</strong> Can benefits be reduced by Social
          Security disability and workers’ compensation payments? Are
          the benefits adjusted for inflation? Will the policy provider
          continue making contributions to your pension plan so you have
          retirement benefits when the disability coverage ends?

    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Affordable Care Act</h2>
      
    <p>
      The 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) puts in place comprehensive
      health insurance reforms that will roll out over several years.
      Most provisions will take effect by 2014; a timeline is available
      at
      <a href="healthcare.gov/law/timeline">healthcare.gov/law/timeline</a>. The
      law is intended to lower health care costs, provide more health
      care choices, and enhance the quality of health care for all
      Americans. Major provisions affecting consumers include:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Coverage for seniors who hit the Medicare Prescription Drug
          “donut hole,” including a rebate for those who reach the gap
          in drug coverage.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Expanded coverage for young adults, allowing them to stay on
          their parents’ plan until they are 26 years old.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Providing access to insurance for uninsured Americans with
          pre-existing conditions.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Expanded preventive care (for example, wellness visits and

    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Group Policies</h2>
      
    <p>
      Many consumers have health care coverage from their employers.
      Others have medical care paid through a government program such as
      Medicare (p. 100), Medicaid (p. 100), or the Veterans Health 
      Administration (p. 105).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have lost your group coverage from an employer as the result of
      unemployment, death, divorce, or loss of “dependent child” status,
      you may be able to continue your coverage temporarily under the
      Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). You, not
      the employer, pay for this coverage. When one of these events 
      occurs, you must be given at least 60 days to decide
      whether you wish to purchase the coverage.
    </p>
      <p>
      Some states offer an
      insurance pool to residents who are unable to obtain coverage 
      because of a health condition. To find
      out whether a pool is available in your state, check with your
      state department of insurance (p. 130).

      <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Health Care Plans</h1>
    
    <p>
      When purchasing health insurance, your choices typically will fall
      into one of three categories:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Traditional</strong> fee-for-service
          health insurance plans are usually the most expensive choice,
          but they offer you the most flexibility in choosing health
          care providers.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Health maintenance organizations (HMOs)</strong> 
          offer lower co-payments and cover the costs of more preventive
      care, but your choice of health care providers is limited. The
      National Committee for Quality Assurance evaluates and accredits
      HMOs. You can find out whether one is accredited in your state by
      calling 1-888-275-7585. You can also get this information, as well
      as report cards on HMOs, by visiting
      <a href="http://www.ncqa.org">www.ncqa.org</a>.
    </p>
      </li><li>
    <p>
      <strong>Preferred provider organizations
      (PPOs)</strong> offer lower co-payments like HMOs, but give you
      more flexibility in selecting a provider. A PPO gives you a list
      of providers you can choose from.
    </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      <strong>WARNING: If you go outside the HMO or PPO network of providers,
        you may have to pay a portion or all of the cost.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      When choosing among different health care plans, you’ll need to
      read the fine print and ask lots of questions, such as:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Do I have the right to go to any doctor, hospital, clinic, or
          pharmacy I choose?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Are specialists such as eye doctors and dentists covered?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Does the plan cover special conditions or treatments such as
          pregnancy, psychiatric care, and physical therapy?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Does the plan cover home care or nursing home care?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Will the plan cover all medications my physician may
          prescribe?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          What are the deductibles? Are there any co-payments?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          What is the most I will have to pay out of my own pocket to
          cover expenses?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          If there is a dispute about a bill or service, how is it
          handled? In some plans, you may be required to have a third
          party decide how to settle the problem.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
      </section>
    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Homeowners/Renters Insurance</h1>
      
    <p>
      You may be able to save hundreds of dollars a year on homeowners
      insurance by shopping around. You can also save money by following
      these tips:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Consider a higher deductible. Increasing your deductible by
          just a few hundred dollars can make a big difference in your
          premiums.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask your insurance agent about discounts. You may be able to
          get a lower premium if your home has safety features such as
          dead-bolt locks, smoke detectors, an alarm system, storm
          shutters, or fire-retardant roofing material. Persons over 
          55 years of age or long-term customers may also be offered discounts.
    </p>
    </li><li>
        <p>
          Insure your house, NOT the land under it. After a disaster,
          the land is still there. If you don’t subtract the value of
          the land when deciding how much homeowners insurance to buy,
          you will pay more than you should.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Don’t wait until you have a loss to find out whether you have
          the right type and amount of insurance.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Make certain you purchase enough coverage to replace what is
          insured. “Replacement” coverage gives you the money to rebuild
          your home and replace its contents. An “Actual Cash Value”
          policy is cheaper but pays the difference between your
          property’s worth at the time of loss minus depreciation for
          age and wear.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask about any special coverage you might need. You may have to
          pay extra for computers, cameras, jewelry, art, antiques,
          musical instruments, stamp collections, etc.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Remember that flood and earthquake damage are not covered by a
          standard homeowners policy. The cost of a separate earthquake
          policy will depend on the likelihood of earthquakes in your
          area. Homeowners who live in areas prone to flooding should
          take advantage of the National Flood Insurance Program (p. 102).
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          If you are a renter, do not assume your landlord carries
          insurance on your personal belongings. Purchase a separate policy
          for renters.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    </section>
    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Life Insurance</h1>
      
    <p>
      Your need for life insurance will change with changes in your
      life. For example, the arrival of children usually triggers a
      sharp increase in the amount you will need. As children grow older
      and leave the nest, you will probably need less protection. You
      should also consider your life insurance policies as you are
      planning for retirement (p. 37).
    </p>
    <p>
      Term life insurance policies are the least costly. They pay death
      benefits but have no cash value if you decide to stop making
      payments. As the word “term” suggests, these policies are in
      effect for a specific period—one year or until you reach a certain
      age are common. Visit
      <a href="http://www.accuquote.com">www.accuquote.com</a> for
      online comparisons of term life insurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whole life, universal life, and other cash value policies combine
      a long-term savings and investment product with life insurance.
      Canceling these policies after only a few years can more than
      double your life insurance costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have misplaced a life insurance policy, your state’s
      insurance commission may be able to help you locate it. Or you can
      search for it at
      <a href="http://www.policylocator.org">www.policylocator.org</a>. If
      the insurance company knows that an insured person has
      died, but cannot locate the beneficiaries, the company must turn
      the benefits over to the state’s unclaimed property office. Check 
      with that office if you believe that you are due a benefit.
    </p>
      <p>
      You can avoid losing your life insurance policy by
      alerting the policy beneficiaries and filing a copy with your
      will.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Long-Term Care Insurance</h1>
      
    <p>
      Medical advances have resulted in greater need for nursing home
      care and assisted living. Most health insurance plans and Medicare
      severely limit or exclude long-term care. You should consider
      these costs as you plan for your retirement (p. 37).
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some questions to ask when considering a separate
      long-term care insurance policy:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>What qualifies you for
          benefits?</strong> Some insurers say you must be unable to
          perform a specific number of the following activities of daily
          living: eating, walking, getting from bed to a chair,
          dressing, bathing, using the restroom, and remaining
          continent.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>What type of care is
          covered?</strong> Does the policy cover nursing home care?
          What about coverage for assisted-living facilities that
          provide less client care than a nursing home? If you want to
          stay in your home, will it pay for care provided by visiting
          nurses and therapists? What about help with food preparation
          and housecleaning?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>What will the benefit amount
          be?</strong> Most plans are written to provide a specific
          dollar benefit per day. The benefit for home care is usually
          about half the nursing home benefit, but some policies pay the
          same for both forms of care. Other plans pay only for your
          actual expenses.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>What is the benefit period?</strong>
          It is possible to get a policy with lifetime benefits, but
          this can be very expensive. Other options for coverage are
          from one to six years. The average nursing home stay is about
          2.5 years.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Is the benefit adjusted for
          inflation?</strong> If you buy a policy before age 60, you
          face the risk that a fixed daily benefit will not be enough by
          the time you need it.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Is there a waiting period before benefits begin?</strong> 
          A 20- to 100-day period is not unusual. See page 26 for more 
          information about advance medical directives.

    <p>
      If you have a financial goal in mind, such as saving for
      retirement, paying for college, or buying a new house, then you
      may decide to invest your money to earn enough to fund your goals.
      Before you invest, do some homework. What is your tolerance for
      risk? What do you want to invest in? Stocks? Bonds? Mutual funds?
      Do you want to open an IRA or buy an annuity? Does your employer
      offer a 401(k)? Remember, every investment involves some degree of
      risk. Most securities are not insured by the federal government if
      they lose money or fail, even if you purchase them through a bank
      or credit union that offers federally insured savings accounts.
      Make sure you have answers to all of these questions before you
      invest:
    </p>
      <ul><li>
      <p>
        <strong>How quickly can you get your money back?</strong>
      Stocks, bonds, and shares in mutual funds usually can be sold at
      any time, but there is no guarantee you will get back all the
      money you paid for them. Other investments, such as limited
      partnerships, certificates of deposit (CDs), or IRAs, often
      restrict your ability to cash out your holdings.
    </p>
        </li><li>
    <p>
      <strong>What can you expect to earn on your money?</strong>
      While bonds generally promise a fixed return, earnings on most
      other securities go up and down with market changes. Keep in mind
      that just because an investment has done well in the past, there
      is no guarantee it will do well in the future.
    </p>
        </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>What type of earnings can you
          expect?</strong> Will you get income in the form of
          interest, dividends, or rent? Some investments, such as stocks
          and real estate, have the potential for earnings and growth in
          value. What is the potential for earnings over time?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>How much risk is involved?</strong>
          With any investment, there is always the risk that you won’t
          get your money back or the earnings promised. There is usually
          a trade-off between risk and reward—the higher the potential
          return, the greater the risk. The federal government insures
          bank savings accounts and backs up U.S. Treasury securities
          (including savings bonds). See FDIC on page 106 and the chart
          on page 7 for regulatory information. Other investment options
          are not protected.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Are your investments
          diversified?</strong> Some investments perform better than
          others in certain situations. For example, when interest rates
          go up, bond prices tend to go down. One industry may struggle
          while another prospers. Putting your money in a variety of
          investment options can help to reduce your risk.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Are there any tax advantages to a
          particular investment?</strong> U.S. Savings Bonds are exempt
          from state and local taxes. Municipal bonds are exempt from
          federal income tax and, sometimes, state income tax as well.
          Tax-deferred investments for special goals, such as paying for
          college and retirement, are available that let you postpone or
          even avoid paying income taxes.

        <p>
          Deceptive pitches for investments often misrepresent or leave 
          out facts to promote fantastic profits with little risk. No 
          investment is risk-free, and a high rate of return means 
          greater risk. Before investing, get written information such 
          as a prospectus or annual report. Beware if a salesperson:

    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Financial Brokers and Advisors</h1>
      
    <p>
      When selecting a broker or investment advisor, research the
      person’s education and professional history as well as the firm
      the person works for. Ask:
    </p>
      <ul><li>
      <p>
      Has the person worked with others who have circumstances similar
      to yours?
    </p>
        </li><li>
        <p>
          Is the person licensed in your state? Your state securities
          regulator (p. 134) lists individuals and firms that are
          registered in your state. Ask whether the regulatory office
          has any other background information. You can find out how to
          reach your state securities regulator by visiting
          <a href="http://www.nasaa.org">www.nasaa.org</a>.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Has the person had any run-ins with regulators or received
          serious complaints from investors? Call your local state
          securities regulator or the SEC (p. 108). You can also check
          out

        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          How is the person paid? Is it an hourly rate, a flat fee, or a
          commission that depends on the investments you make? Does the
          person get a bonus from his or her firm for selling you a
          particular product?

    <p>
      Many financial experts recommend buying gold as part of a balanced
      portfolio. Some suggest buying only a small amount because values
      can fluctuate; others recommend larger investments.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a number of ways to invest in precious metals; common
      ones include bullion, certificates, and coins. Most people depend
      on an investment advisor or company to help them choose. Make sure
      the person or company you choose is licensed with your state
      securities administrator (p. 134). If you’re considering investing
      in gold, check the U.S. Mint website at
      <a href="http://www.usmint.gov">www.usmint.gov</a>. Before you
      purchase coins or coin-related products, research the seller with
      your state consumer protection office (p. 112) or Better Business
      Bureau (p. 67).

      Commodity futures are an agreement to buy or sell a specific

    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Retirement Planning</h1>
      
    <p>
      Part of smart investing is planning for retirement. The average
      American spends 20 years in retirement, but fewer than half of
      Americans calculate how much they need to save for their
      retirement years. Regardless of your age, it’s never too early or
      too late to start.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three major components of a retirement portfolio are generally
      benefits from pensions, savings and investments, and Social
      Security.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are still working and your employer offers a plan, find out
      how it works. If your employer has a 401(k) plan and offers to put
      some money in if you do (called a match), this should be the first
      place where you save. Make sure you understand how a job change
      might affect your employer-based retirement plan and what your
      options are for saving that money. If you switch jobs before you
      are fully vested, you may lose a significant amount of money.

              Russell 2000. An index fund is managed passively and
              mirrors the performance of the designated stock or bond
              index.

              Risk level depends on which index the fund
              uses. A bond index fund involves a lower risk level than
              an index fund of emerging markets overseas.

      As you approach retirement, there are many factors to consider.
      Experts advise that you will need about 80% of your pre-retirement
      income in your retirement years. The exact amount, of course,
      depends on your individual needs (see Elder Care, p. 25). For
      example:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Will your spouse or partner retire when you do?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Where do you plan to live? Will you downsize, own, or rent?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Will you have the same medical insurance you had while
          working? Will coverage change?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Do you want to travel or pursue a new hobby that might be
          costly?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          If you have a financial advisor, talk to him or her about your plans.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      In addition to planning to maintain your lifestyle
      during retirement, you may need to purchase long-term health
      insurance (p. 34) or to pay for assisted-living services (p. 25).

      Identity thieves steal your personal information to commit fraud.
      They can damage your credit status and cost you time and money to
      restore your good name. To reduce your risk of becoming a victim,
      follow these tips:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Don’t carry your Social Security
          card</strong> in your wallet or write your number on your
          checks. Only give out your SSN when absolutely necessary.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Protect your PIN.</strong> Never
          write a PIN on a credit/debit card or on a slip of paper kept
          in your wallet.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Watch out for “shoulder
          surfers.”</strong> Use your free hand to shield the keypad
          when typing your passwords on computers and at ATMs.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Collect mail promptly.</strong> Ask
          the post office to put your mail on hold when you are away
          from home for more than a day or two.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Pay attention to your billing
          cycles.</strong> If bills or financial statements are late,
          contact the sender.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Keep your receipts.</strong> Ask for
          carbons and incorrect charge slips as well. Promptly compare
          receipts with account statements. Watch for unauthorized
          transactions.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Tear up or shred</strong> unwanted
          receipts, credit offers, account statements, expired cards,
          etc., to prevent “dumpster divers” (see p. 7) from getting
          your personal information.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Store personal information in a safe
          place</strong> at home and at work. Don’t leave it lying
          around.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Don’t respond to unsolicited
          requests</strong> for personal information in the mail, over
          the phone, or online.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Install firewalls</strong> and
          virus-detection software on your home computer.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Create complex
          passwords</strong> that identity thieves cannot guess easily.
          For tips on creating secure passwords, see p. 40.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Check your credit report once a
          year.</strong> Check it more frequently if you suspect
          someone has gained access to your account information. See
          Free Credit Reports (p. 12).
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Reporting Identity Theft</h1>
      
    <p>
      If you suspect or become a victim of identity theft, follow these
      steps:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Report it to your financial
          institution.</strong> Call the phone number on your account
          statement or on the back of your credit or debit card.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Report the fraud to your local
          police.</strong> Keep a copy of the police report, which
          will make it easier to prove your case to creditors and
          retailers.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Contact the credit reporting
          bureaus</strong> (p. 13) and ask them to flag your account
          with a fraud alert, which asks merchants not to grant new
          credit without your approval.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      If your identity has been stolen, you can use an ID Theft
      affidavit to report the theft to most of the parties involved. All
      three credit bureaus and many major creditors accept the
      affidavit. Request a copy of the document by calling toll-free
      1-877-ID-THEFT (438-4338) or visit
      <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/idtheft">www.ftc.gov/idtheft</a>. You
      can also use this website to file a complaint with the FTC.
    </p>
    <p>
      The FTC also publishes a series of publications about the
      importance of personal information privacy. To download copies, go
      to <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">www.ftc.gov</a> or request free
      copies of brochures by calling 1-877-FTC-HELP (382-4357).

    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>If Your Wallet Is Stolen</h5>
      
    <p>
      Your wallet contains some of your most important personal items,
      from hard-earned money to credit cards and driver’s license. For
      an identity thief, your wallet offers a treasure trove of personal
      information. If your wallet is lost or stolen:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          File a report with the police immediately.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Cancel your credit and debit cards and request new cards 
          and account numbers.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Report the missing cards to the major credit reporting
          agencies.
        </p>

      Today, it’s quick and easy to get a credit card approved, transfer
      money from one account to another, renew your driver’s license,
      fill a prescription from your doctor at your local pharmacy, use
      store loyalty cards, and purchase products online. But you pay for
      this convenience by providing more opportunities for your personal
      information to be changed, stolen, or reported inaccurately.
      Companies can also use the information you have shared to direct
      their future marketing efforts or can sell the information to
      other companies.
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Child ID Theft</h5>
      
    <p>
      Children are especially vulnerable to identity theft. The 
      danger is that child ID theft goes unnoticed for years,
      until the child becomes an adult and tries to apply for credit
      or to college. Scam artists use the stolen ID to get
      credit, jobs, medical care, and more. To protect your 
      child’s future, shred all documents with their personal 
      information. Also check your child’s credit report (if there 
      is a credit report, this is a clue that theft has occurred). 
      For more information contact the FTC (p. 107).

        <p>
          To help protect your privacy, follow these tips:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Look for privacy statements on websites, sales materials, and
          forms you fill out. If a website claims to follow a set of
          established voluntary standards, read the standards. Don’t
          assume it provides the level of privacy you want.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask how your personal information will be stored and used.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Only provide the purchase date, model/serial numbers, and your
          contact information on warranty registration forms.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Discuss privacy with others in your home. Everyone, even
          children, should understand what information is not
          appropriate to share on the phone, while using a computer, and
          in other situations.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      Check with your state or local consumer agency (p. 112) to find
      out whether any state laws help protect your privacy. Some
      companies and industry groups have also adopted voluntary policies
      that address privacy concerns.
    </p>
    </section>
      <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Financial Privacy</h1>
        
    <p>
      The FDIC (p. 106) and other federal regulators require banks,
      insurance companies, brokerage firms, and certain businesses that
      share financial information to inform you of their privacy
      policies. They must give you this information when you open an
      account and at least once every year. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          The kinds of information being collected
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          How the confidentiality and security of this information will
          be protected
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          What types of businesses may be provided this information
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      If a business is going to share the information with
      anyone outside its corporate family, it must also give you the
      chance to “opt out” or say no to information sharing. Even if you
      don’t opt out, your account numbers may not be shared with third
      parties for marketing purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot prevent certain types of information from being shared,
      including information needed to conduct normal business or protect 
      against fraud, or information that is
      already publicly available. Also, a bank can share your
      information with a partner company to market products.
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Tax ID Theft</h5>
      
    <p>
      Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information
      such as your name, Social Security number (SSN), or other
      identifying information, without your permission, to commit fraud
      or other crimes. Usually, an identity thief uses a legitimate
      taxpayer’s identity to file a tax return fraudulently and claim 
      a refund early in the filing season.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you believe someone has used your SSN fraudulently, contact the 
      IRS immediately at 1-800-908-4490. You will need to fill out the 
      IRS Identity Theft Affidavit, Form 14039. For more information, visit 
      <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Taxpayer-Guide-to-Identity-Theft">www.irs.gov/uac/Taxpayer-Guide-to-Identity-Theft</a>.
    </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      Your credit information has additional privacy protections under
      the FCRA. Only people with a legitimate business need can get a
      copy of your report. An employer can only get your report with
      your written consent. For more information on your rights under
      this federal law, and to find out how you can get a copy of your
      credit reports, see Credit Reports and Scores on page 13.

      <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Medical Privacy</h1>
        
    <p>
      Personal information you give to your doctor is shared with
      insurance companies, pharmacies, researchers, and employers based
      on specific regulations. The privacy of your health records is
      protected by federal law, specifically under the Health Insurance
      Portability and Accountability Act, also known as HIPAA. HIPAA:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Defines your rights over your health information
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Sets rules and limits on who is allowed to receive 
          and/or see your health information
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Create Secure Passwords</h5>
      
    <p>
      The number of passwords you need daily can be overwhelming. It is
      tempting to use the same password across several sites; however to
      get the most protection available, you should use different
      passwords on each site and change your passwords periodically. The
      goal for creating passwords is to strike a balance between being
      something that is easy to remember and unique.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some general tips for creating a secure password include:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and
          special characters.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          The longer the password, the better it is.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Don’t use your name, birthday, license plate, favorite sports
          teams, or other facts that are easily guessed.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Create a password based on a phrase. For example, “A stitch in
          time saves nine,” can be translated into the password
          “Ast!Ts9”, where each character represents a word in the
          phrase.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          If you must use the same password on several websites, add a
          prefix or suffix. For example, use “Ast!Ts9:4bnk” for your
          bank account and “Eml: Ast!Ts9” for your email account.
        </p>

      under the HIPAA Privacy Rule violated your health information
      privacy rights or committed another violation of the Privacy Rule,
      you may be able to file a written complaint with the Department of
      Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (p. 98).

      In addition to following the general advice on protecting your
      privacy, make sure you only use websites with acceptable privacy
      policies.
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Look for a privacy policy statement or seal that indicates the
          site abides by privacy standards. Take the time to read how
          your privacy is protected.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Look for signals that you are using a secure web page. A
          secure site encrypts or scrambles personal information so it
          cannot be intercepted easily. Signals include a screen notice
          that says you are on a secure site, a closed padlock or
          unbroken key in the bottom corner of your screen, or the first
          letters of the Internet address you are viewing change from
          “http” to “https.”
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      Another threat to your privacy is spyware, software that is
      secretly installed when you download screensavers, games, music,
      and other applications. Spyware sends information about your
      online activities to a third party, usually to target you with
      pop-up ads. Browsers like Internet Explorer and Firefox, and
      search engines like Google and Bing, enable you to block pop-ups.
      You can also install anti-spyware software to stop this threat to
      your privacy. For more information, see Internet on page 41.

      Choices for phone service, Internet, and television have never
      been greater. As devices have multiple functions, such as the
      ability to watch television shows on your computer or surf the
      Internet using your phone, your decisions about each of these
      services may overlap. Most consumers are now able to bundle phone,
      TV, and Internet service for a discount; however, buying a bundle
      of services could make it more difficult to change providers for
      any one service if you’re tied into a long-term contract. Before
      you buy, compare services and prices and think about what you
      really need.
    </p>
    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Internet</h1>
      
    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Choosing Service Providers</h2>
      
    <p>
      To connect your computer to the Internet, you’ll need an Internet
      Service Provider (ISP). Some ISPs are large and well known, while
      others are literally one-person operations. Some companies limit
      their service to providing Internet access only. Others, such as a
      telephone or cable company, may offer Internet access as part of a
      larger package of services. It is important to compare service
      providers and options to make sure you are getting what you want
      as well as the best deal possible to meet your needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have limited Internet expertise, you may want to start with
      one of the well-known ISPs. They usually offer user-friendly
      startup software that often includes features such as a browser,
      instant messaging, parental controls, and pop-up blockers. Many
      also offer 24-hour tech support. However, this convenience results
      in higher monthly user fees. Once you are comfortable with how the
      Internet works, you may decide you don’t need the “extras” and can
      switch to a lower-cost ISP.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider these factors when selecting a provider:
    </p>
      <ul><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Speed</strong>. If you only want to
      check e-mail and read web pages, a dial-up connection may be
      enough. But if you want to download music or television shows or
      watch videos, you will need a faster connection with broadband
      access, such as a digital subscriber line (DSL), cable modem, or
      satellite.
    </p>
    </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Availability</strong>. Which
          companies offer service in your area?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Wireless access</strong>. Can you
          get a wireless connection for other computers in your home?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>E-mail</strong>. Do e-mail accounts
          come with the service? What will be the storage limit on your
          mailbox?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Software</strong>. Is any software
          required to activate the service?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Support</strong>. What kinds of
          support are available—phone, e-mail, chat, etc.? Is the
          support free?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Special features</strong>. What
          services are provided for spam blocking, virus protection,
          instant messaging, and chat rooms?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Terms of service</strong>. Is there
          a limit to the amount of data you can use per month?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Cost</strong>. What is the monthly
          fee for the service? Are there fees for renting a modem or set
          up?
        </p>

    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>WiFi (Wireless)</h2>
      
    <p>
      Going wireless provides you with the freedom to use your computer
      in multiple locations, without dragging cables and cords with you.
      However, with the privilege of increased freedom comes the danger
      of increased vulnerability. Wireless Internet requires that you
      have access to a wireless network via a wireless router. It is
      important that you secure your network so strangers (or neighbors)
      can’t use your network without your knowledge (also known as
      “piggybacking”). Also, computer hackers could use your network to
      access personal information you save or send from your computer.
      This is particularly important if you conduct financial
      transactions online. If you use the wireless (Wi-Fi) network at
      bookstores, airports, or other public places, there are other
      precautions you should take to protect your privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At home:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Turn on encryption.</strong> When
          you buy a wireless router, it is important to turn on the
          encryption feature. This scrambles information that you send
          over the Internet so other people cannot access it.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Rename your router.</strong> Change
          the name from the default to something only you would know.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Change the password.</strong>
          Routers come with a standard password. Create a new one with a
          mix of letters, numbers, and special characters. For help
          creating passwords, see page 40.

      <p>If you’ve ever received a “security alert” stating 
        that malicious software was found on your computer, it 
        may have been scareware. These messages will persuade 
        you that your computer is infected with a virus that 
        you can eliminate only by purchasing and installing specific 
        software. Don’t follow that advice; shut down your browser 
        without clicking on the message. If you believe your

          <strong>Be aware of cookies.</strong>Cookies

      On public wireless networks:
    </p>
      <ul><li>
    <p>
      <strong>Don’t assume the network is
      secure.</strong> Most public wireless networks don’t encrypt
      information you send. Avoid sending private information from
      public locations.
    </p>
        </li><li>
    <p>
      <strong>Use encrypted websites.</strong>If you
      must send sensitive information from a public network, make
      certain that URL starts with “https” (“s” means secure). Look for
      that on every page you visit.
    </p>
        </li><li>
    <p>
      <strong>Log off</strong>sites after you finish
      using them rather than using “remember me” features. It is better
      to log in again than give away your login credentials to someone
      else on the network.

    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Online File Sharing</h2>
      
    <p>
      Every day, millions of computer users share files online. Whether
      music, games, video, or software, peer-topeer (P2P) file sharing
      allows users to share all kinds of content. To share files, you
      download special software that connects your computer to an
      informal network of other computers running the same software. The
      software is often free and easy to access.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, file sharing can have a number of risks. For example,
      when you are connected to file-sharing programs, you unknowingly
      could allow others to copy private files you never intended to
      share. You could download material that is protected by copyright
      laws and find yourself mired in legal issues; you could download a
      virus or facilitate a security breach; or you could unwittingly
      download pornography labeled as something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      To secure the personal information stored on your computer, the
      FTC suggests that you:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Set up the file-sharing software very carefully.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Be aware of spyware and use a good anti-spyware program.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Close your connection when you’re not using it.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Use an effective anti-virus program and update it regularly.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Talk with your family about file sharing.

    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Online Copyright Issues</h2>
      
    <p>
      Quite simply, it’s illegal to make or download unauthorized copies
      of software or online media, such as books, music, and videos.
      Whether you are casually making a few copies for friends, lending
      disks, distributing and/or downloading pirated software via the
      Internet, or buying a single software program and then installing
      it on 100 computers, you are committing a copyright infringement.
      It doesn’t matter whether or not you make money doing it. If you
      or your company is caught copying software, you may be held liable
      under both civil and criminal law. If the copyright owner brings a
      civil action against you, the owner can seek to stop you from
      using its software immediately and can request monetary damages.
      The copyright owner can sue for as much as $150,000 for each
      program copied. In addition, the government can prosecute you
      criminally for copyright infringement. If convicted, you can be
      fined up to $250,000, sentenced to jail for up to five years, or
      both.

    <p>
      Today many consumers purchase music and e-books as digital
      downloads to play on digital music players or mobile devices.
      However, just because you buy the file, doesn’t mean you actually
      own the song. A media service provider sells you a license to
      listen to your downloaded music, but that license may restrict
      your ability to lend, share, transfer, or burn the contents of
      your music library. You may be able to use the songs on several
      devices; the rules vary from provider to provider. Before you
      download or click “I Agree,” know your rights under the terms of
      service agreement. For more information about digital copyright,

    <p>
      The Internet gives you easy access to information, 
      entertainment, financial offers, and countless other 
      services. The flip side, however, is that it can leave
      you vulnerable to online scammers, identity thieves, and criminals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Online frauds are not limited to fake companies. 
      Thieves will often try to disguise a fraudulent website 
      by giving the site a URL close to the URL of a
      legitimate, well-known site. Internet criminals try to trick
      customers of these legitimate sites into sharing their personal 
      information on fake sites, so they can use that
      information for identity theft or credit card fraud schemes. Some 
      scam artists have even used the IRS name and logo to collect 
      taxpayers’ personal information so they can
      steal taxpayers’ identity. Visit <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Suspicious-e-Mails-and-Identity-Theft">www.irs.gov/uac/Suspicious-e-Mails-and-Identity-Theft</a>
      to learn more about tax-related online fraud and how to 
      identify a fraudulent e-mail or website. To guard against 
      Internet fraud, follow these tips:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Know your seller.</strong> If you
          don’t, do some research.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Company websites</strong> often
          provide information in a section called “About Us.” Some
          online sellers participate in programs, such as BBBOnLine,
          that help resolve problems. Look for a logo or endorsement
          seal on the company website; this indication, however, is not
          a guarantee of the seller’s reliability.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Check with state</strong> and/or
          local consumer offices.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Reading comments from other
          consumers</strong> is another way to check the integrity of
          online sellers. Some Internet auction sites post ratings of
          sellers based on buyers’ comments. Beware of too many glowing
          stories the sellers themselves might have placed.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Protect your personal
          information</strong>. Don’t provide it in response to an
          e-mail, a pop-up, or a website you’ve linked to from an e-mail
          or web page.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Take your time</strong> and resist
          any urge to “act now” to keep your account open or take
          advantage of a special offer.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Use anti-virus and anti-spyware
          software</strong>, as well as a firewall, and update them
          all regularly. Make sure your operating system and web browser
          are set up properly and update them regularly as well.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Protect your passwords</strong>.
          Don’t share your passwords with anyone. Memorize them.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Don’t take the bait.</strong> Don’t
          reply to e-mail messages that claim your credit card
          information or other personal information needs to be updated.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Back up important files</strong>.
          Copy them onto another computer or a removable hard drive such
          as a flash memory stick.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      Learn whom to contact if something goes wrong online. Report
      suspected fraud to your bank, credit card company, or relevant
      authority.

    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Social Networking</h5>
      
    <p>
      Social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,
      Pinterest, and others continue to gain popularity. These sites
      make it easy to reconnect, stay in touch, and even do business.
      But recent reports involving privacy concerns and crimes should
      make users more careful about the information they share. Some
      tips to consider to protect your privacy and safety include:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Make your contact information private.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Limit who can search your profile from Internet search
          engines.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Manage who can view your images; untag photos if necessary.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Create separate lists to manage who can see the information
          you’ve posted.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Be careful about who can see your status updates.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Refrain from telling people where you are at any specific
          time.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Be cautious about arranging meetings in person with online
          acquaintances.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Keep in mind that current or prospective employers may be able
          to see your social network pages and photos.

    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Spam</h2>
      
    <p>
      E-mail spam is not just unwanted; it can be offensive. Decrease
      the number of spam e-mails you receive by making it difficult for
      spammers to get and use your e-mail address:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Don’t use an obvious e-mail address, such as <em data-type="email">JaneDoe@isp.com</em>.
          Instead use numbers or other digits, such as <em data-type="email">Jane4oe6@isp.com</em>.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Use one e-mail address for close friends and family and
          another for everyone else. Free addresses are available from
          Yahoo!, Gmail, and Hotmail. You can also get a disposable
          forwarding address from
          <a href="http://www.spammotel.com">www.spammotel.com</a>. If
          an address attracts too much spam, get rid of it and establish
          a new one.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Don’t post your e-mail address on a public web page. Spammers
          use software that harvests text addresses. Substitute
          “jane4oe6 at isp.com” for “jane4oe6@isp. com,” or display your
          address as a graphic image, not text.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Don’t enter your address on a website before you check its
          privacy policy.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Uncheck any checked boxes. These often grant the site or its
          partners permission to contact you.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Don’t click on an e-mail’s “unsubscribe” link unless you trust
          the sender. This action tells the sender you are there.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Never forward chain letters, petitions, or virus warnings. All
          could be a spammer’s trick to collect addresses.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Disable your e-mail “preview pane.” This stops spam from
          reporting to its sender that you’ve received it.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Choose an ISP that filters e-mail. If you get lots of spam,
          your ISP may not be filtering effectively.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Use spam-blocking software. Web browser software often
          includes free filtering options. You can also purchase special
          software that will accomplish this task.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Report spam. Alert your ISP that spam is slipping through its
          filters. The FTC also wants to know about “unsolicited
          commercial e-mail.” Forward spam to <em data-type="email">spam@uce.gov</em>.

    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Phones</h1>
    
    <p>
      The choices for phone service have never been greater. Most
      consumers are now able to buy local and long-distance phone
      service from their telephone company, cable or satellite TV
      provider, or ISP. Services such as voice mail, call waiting,
      caller ID, and wireless may be offered as a package deal or sold
      separately. Before you buy, compare services and prices and think
      about what you really need:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Whom do you call most often?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          What time of day or day of the week do you call?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Do you want to get messages? If so, do you need voice mail, or
          will an answering machine do?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Do you want call waiting and/or caller ID?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          How important is it for you to have your phone with you
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      when you are away from home? Find out how each company prices its
      services. Are there minimum use, time-of-day, or distance
      requirements; flat monthly fees; or special plans? For example,
      wireless service may be cheaper than regular local service if you
      don’t make many calls. Make sure you’re comparing prices on
      similar plans and features. Understand that many service providers
      offer contracts for specific periods. Read the fine print and ask
      questions if there is anything you’re not clear about.
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Bundling, Promotions, And Deals</h5>
      
    <p>
      Do you want to get Internet, telephone, and TV service from the
      same provider? Buying a bundle of services from one provider can
      be a good deal, but it can also make it more difficult to change
      providers for any one service if you’re tied into a long-term
      contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      Special promotions such as introductory pricing may be enticing,
      but read the fine print. The promotion price probably does not
      include taxes or the cost of extra equipment or fees. Ask the
      provider to explain all the one-time, recurring, and special
      charges, including taxes and fees. Get all promises in writing.
      Ask when the special promotions end and what the post-promotion
      cost will be. Also find out whether you have to install any
      special equipment and whether the provider will help troubleshoot
      on the phone if you have any problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some deals are available only online or by phone. Even if you have
      to order online, call the provider first to ask questions. When
      you are online, review any frequently asked questions, minimum
      system requirements, and fine-print terms and conditions. Read the
      entire customer service agreement and print a copy for your
      records. For more information, visit
      <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/consumer.shtm">www.ftc.gov/bcp/consumer.shtm</a>.

    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Beware: Caller ID Spoofing</h5>
      
      <p>
        Scammers have adopted the practice of Caller ID spoofing to 
        obtain personal information from consumers. In this fraud, 
        someone calls you using a false name and phone number for 
        the Caller ID screen. During the call, the scammer describes 
        an urgent scenario, such as the cancellation of an account. 
        The caller may say you can avoid the cancellation if you 
        provide your bank account or credit card number to pay the 
        company. If you give the sensitive information, the caller 
        can use it to steal your identity or use your bank accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can prevent being a victim of caller ID spoofing. 
        Don’t give out personal information on an incoming call. 
        Hang up and call the customer service phone number printed 
        on your statement, on the company’s website, or in the 
        phonebook.
      </p>
      <p>
        Report caller ID spoofers to the Federal Communications 
        Commission at <a href="http://fcc.gov/complaints">fcc.gov/complaints</a> or 1-888-225-5322.

    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Slamming and Cramming</h2>
      
    <p>
      “Slamming” occurs when a phone company illegally switches your
      phone service without your permission. If you notice a different
      company name on your bill or see phone charges that are higher
      than normal, contact the company that slammed you and ask to be
      switched back to your original company. Tell the company you are
      exercising your right to refuse to pay charges, then report the
      problem to your original company and ask to be re-enrolled in your
      previous calling plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cramming” occurs when companies add charges to your phone bill
      without your permission. These charges may be for services such as
      voice mail, ringtones, or subscriptions. You may not notice these
      monthly charges because they are relatively small, $5 to $30, and
      look like your regular phone charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Take These Steps to Avoid Slammers and Crammers:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Block changes to your phone service.</strong> Ask your telephone
          service provider if it offers a blocking or account protection
          service, which usually requires the company to notify you
          before making any changes to your service.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Read the fine print</strong> on
          contest entry forms and coupons. You could be agreeing to
          switch your phone service or to buy optional services.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Watch out for impostors.</strong>
          Companies could falsely claim to be your regular phone company
          and offer some type of discount plan or change in billing.
          They may also say they are taking a survey or they may pretend
          to be a government agency.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Beware of “negative option
          notices.”</strong> You can be switched or signed up for
          optional services unless you say “NO” to telemarketers.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Examine your telephone bill</strong>
          carefully, including pages that show the details, and look for
          suspicious charges.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      Your phone service cannot be shut off for refusal to pay for
      unauthorized services. For help, contact your local or state
      consumer protection agency (p. 112), state public utilities
      commission (p. 138), or the FCC (p. 106).

    </section>
    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Cell Phones</h2>
      
    <p>
      Before you sign a contract and choose a plan and a company that
      meets your needs, you should ask these types of questions:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Where can you make and receive
      calls?</strong> Most providers now offer a choice of local,
      regional, or national plans. A local plan offers low-cost options
      if most of your calls are near your home. Regional plans cover a
      larger geographic area—sometimes several states. If you call
      outside the area covered by these plans, you will pay
      long-distance and roaming charges in addition to the airtime used.
      National plans are the most expensive, but they let you use your
      phone anywhere in the country for a single per-minute price.
    </p>
    <figure float="0"><figcaption/><img src="images/pdf5131_img_28.png"/></figure>
    <p>
      <strong>How frequently will you use the
      phone?</strong> If you just want a phone for emergencies, an
      economy plan with a few minutes a month may be all you need. On
      the other hand, if your cell phone is your primary phone, a plan
      with the lowest airtime rate is a wiser choice. If you plan to use
      texting, pick a plan that will meet your needs and avoid surprises
      on your bills. Most services allow you to upgrade a plan without
      an added one-time charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Is a family plan option
      available?</strong>You can share one cellular service plan and a
      pool of monthly usage minutes among several phone lines. The cost
      of the additional numbers per month is usually less than if you
      purchased individual accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Is there a trial
      period?</strong> There are “dead spots” where a cell phone doesn’t 
      work. A trial period lets you test your service and try the features 
      of the phone without incurring a termination fee.
</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Know your options.</strong>
      Make sure you are only buying the options or features you really need. 
      It is always easier to upgrade a plan later if you feel you need another 
      feature.
</p>
      <p>
        <strong>What if you want to cancel your
      service?</strong> Most providers have a penalty. This is a concern if you have
      to move out of the area covered by your plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be sure to keep track of your usage and understand your 
        cell phone bill to avoid “bill shock.” Visit

    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>GPS on Your Smartphone</h5>
      
    <p>
      Retailers can use your phone’s GPS for geofencing— sending you
      coupons and promotions when you are near their stores so you’ll
      buy the items there instead of buying the same item online for a
      possibly cheaper price. If you have signed up to receive text
      messages from stores, they may send you an alert with a coupon
      when you are nearby, based on your phone’s GPS.

      <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Smart Phones</h2>
        
    <p>
      Smart phones are like miniature computers; they provide basic
      phone functions, along with advanced features, including browsing
      the Internet, accessing e-mail, interacting on online social
      networks, listening to music, watching videos, uploading pictures,
      and using apps. They also allow use of a QWERTY keyboard to make
      texting and e-mailing easy. (The keys are arranged the same way
      they are on a computer keyboard.)
    </p>
    <p>
      When shopping for a smart phone, consider these tips:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Consider the shape and size of the phone.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Make sure you can use the keypad easily to make calls and send
          messages.
        </p>
      </li><li>
          <p>
            Do you need to access the Internet with your phone? If so, a
            data plan is required. Find out how much it costs; compare
            options carefully. Data plans govern use and costs associated
            with mobile access for e-mail, text messaging, web browsing,
            social networking, and other applications.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Take advantage of special pricing and promotions.
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Is there a limit on the amount of data you can use each month?
          </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>
            Be wary of buying phone insurance, which may sound tempting;
            consumer groups generally advise against it.
          </p>

    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Mobile Payments Using A Digital Wallet</h5>
      
    <p>
      Paying for your purchases using a smart phone app has become more
      common and convenient. In a sense you have a digital wallet that
      contains your credit card numbers, store loyalty cards, and even
      digital coupons. When you get to the checkout counter, you pay by 
      swiping your phone at the checkout. You can also use it online. Before you
      decide to use a digital wallet provider, make certain that your
      phone has the required chip that allows you use the mobile payment
      app. Also find out how the company ensures the security of your
      cards and each transaction. Some questions to ask:
    </p>

      </li><li>
        <p>
          Who is responsible for fraudulent or unauthorized purchases,
          and what is your liability if this happens?

    <p>
      “Apps,” short for applications, are tools that help you accomplish
      tasks or find information when you are on the go. Apps are
      designed to work on smart phones and may be downloaded or accessed
      using your phone’s web browser. Some apps are designed for
      specific platforms (Android, Blackberry, or iPhone), so be sure to
      purchase apps that are compatible with your phone’s software
      requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      While some apps are free, many of them do charge a small fee.
      Before you click “download,” keep in mind that the cost of your
      purchases is deducted automatically from your bank account or
      charged to your credit card or phone bill. Keep track of the
      amount of money you spent on apps to avoid shock when you receive
      your bill.

      privacy and safety concerns apply; however, unlike computers,
      these devices do not have anti-virus software to protect them from
      malware attacks. For more information on how to protect yourself
      from these concerns, see Online Privacy (p. 40) and Internet (p.

      If you want cell phone service only for emergencies, or you aren’t
      sure how much you will actually use a cell phone once you get it,
      you may want to consider a prepaid cell phone before you commit to
      a long-term wireless contract. With a prepaid cell phone, there is
      no contract to sign and no monthly bill. You will know exactly how
      much you spend. The downside of prepaid plans is that you pay more
      per minute, and, if you don’t use the phone for an extended
      period, you may lose the money in your account.

    <p>
      There are many choices for consumers looking to buy new
      televisions today. Before buying a new TV, do your homework. It is
      important to see the monitors in person before buying to make sure
      the one you select will meet your needs. For independent ratings
      and reviews, check out <em>Consumer Reports</em> at
      <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org">www.consumerreports.org</a>.
      Additional information is also available at
      <a href="http://www.energystar.gov">www.energystar.gov</a>.
    </p>
    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Cable</h2>
      
    <p>
      You can start with a basic lineup of channels and go from there.
      The more channels you want, the more it will cost. You may want to
      consider video on demand so you can order movies and sports events
      and watch them when you like (usually within a 24-hour window).
      You can also buy a bundle of services that includes digital TV,
      digital phone, and broadband Internet access at discounted rates.
      Bear in mind, however, that you may be asked to sign a contract
      for bundled services.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Satellite</h2>
    
    <p>
      This requires a dish that’s mounted outside (service requires an
      unobstructed view of the satellite) and a receiver that’s placed
      by your television. Satellite TV offers comparable channels to
      cable TV, and you can add a digital video recorder to record shows
      for viewing later. One downside to satellite TV is occasional
      interference during periods of rain or snow. Check with your
      satellite TV provider for channel options and prices. As with
      cable TV, you may be asked to sign a contract for a package of
      services.

    <p>
      If you have a high-speed Internet connection, you’re already able
      to watch thousands of videos on your computer. Movies and TV shows
      are also available and becoming more prevalent as large online
      companies start distributing TV programming. You may even be able
      to connect your computer to your television so that shows you
      would normally watch online can project on a larger screen.
      Several services allow Internet streaming for a fee, along with
      free access to shows on network websites.

      <figure float="0"><figcaption/><img src="images/pdf5131_img_31.png"/></figure>
    <p>
      What can you do about the growing pile of unwanted mail in your
      mailbox and unwelcome telemarketers on your phone? Actually,
      there’s a lot you can do:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Tell companies you do business with to remove your name from
          customer lists they rent or sell to others. Look for
          information on how to opt out of marketing lists on sales
          materials, order forms, and websites.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Use the services provided by the Direct Marketing Association
          (p. 144) to remove your name from most national telemarketing,
          mail, and e-mail lists.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Call the credit reporting agencies’ notification system at
          1-888-567-8688. This will reduce the number of unsolicited
          credit and insurance offers you get. All three major credit
          bureaus participate in this program.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Under U.S. Postal Service (USPS) rules, it is illegal to send
          mail that looks like it is from a government agency when it
          isn’t. It is also illegal to send mail that looks like a bill
          when nothing was ordered, unless it clearly states that it is
          not a bill. Report violations of this rule to the USPS (p.
          108).
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    </section>
    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>National Do Not Call Registry</h1>
      
    <p>
      The federal government’s Do Not Call Registry allows you to
      restrict telemarketing calls permanently by registering your phone
      number at
      <a href="http://www.donotcall.gov">www.donotcall.gov</a> or by
      calling 1-888-382-1222. If you receive telemarketing calls after
      your number has been in the national registry for three months,
      you can file a complaint using the same web page and toll-free
      number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Placing your number on this national registry will stop most
      telemarketing calls, but not all of them. Calls that are still
      permitted include those from political organizations, charities,
      telephone surveyors, and some organizations with which you have a
      relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, the standard has always been that telemarketers are
      not allowed to call cell phones. Cell phone numbers can also be
      added to the Do Not Call Registry (<a href="https://www.donotcall.gov/"/>), 
      but it is not necessary, since
      telemarketers are already forbidden to call them.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Pre-recorded Messages</h1>
      
    <p>
      Pre-recorded sales calls or robocalls are illegal. Companies
      cannot transmit these messages to consumers who have not agreed,
      in writing, to accept such messages. Pre-recorded calls may only
      be made to residential telephone numbers in the following cases:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Emergency calls needed to ensure your health and safety

      calls but have not agreed to get them, file a complaint with the
      FTC at <a href="http://www.donotcall.gov">www.donotcall.gov</a> or

    </p>
    </section>
    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Telemarketing Sales Calls</h1>
      
    <p>
      An FTC rule defines what telemarketers can and cannot do when
      making a sales call. Callers must:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Provide the seller’s name
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Disclose that the call is a sales call
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Tell you exactly what they’re trying to sell
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Disclose the total cost and other terms of sale before you
          make any payment for goods or services
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Tell you if they don’t allow refunds, exchanges, or
          cancellations
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Opting Out</h5>
      
    <p>
      Tired of unwanted e-mail filling up your inbox? You can opt out of
      most unsolicited e-mail lists by going to the “unsubscribe”
      button, usually found at the bottom of the message. Some senders
      make the button difficult to find, so you may have to do some
      searching.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, the Direct Marketing Association lets you opt out of
      receiving unsolicited commercial mail from many national companies
      for three years. You can register with this service for a small
      fee, but your registration only applies to organizations that use
      the association’s Mail Preference Service. To register, go to
      <a href="http://www.dmachoice.org">www.dmachoice.org</a>. If you
      would like to opt out of credit and insurance offers, you can call
      1-888-567-8688 or go online at
      <a href="http://www.optoutprescreen.com">www.optoutprescreen.com</a>,
      which is managed by the major credit reporting companies.
    </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      If a prize is involved, the caller must give you the odds of
      winning, inform you that no purchase is necessary, and tell you
      how to get instructions for entering without buying anything. It’s
      illegal for telemarketers to:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Misrepresent what they’re offering
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Call before 8 am or after 9 pm
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Threaten, intimidate, or harass you, or call again if you 
          ask them not to
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      This FTC rule applies even when you receive a call
      from a telemarketer in another state or country. It also applies
      when you make a call to a company in another state or country in
      response to a mail solicitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rule generally does not apply when you call to order from a
      catalog or in response to an ad on television or radio, or in a
      magazine or newspaper. It also does not apply to solicitations you
      receive by fax or e-mail. Beware that certain types of businesses,
      including nonprofit organizations, investment brokers and
      advisors, and banks and financial institutions, are exempt from
      the rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you get a phone call from someone who says he or she is with
      your bank and/or credit company and the person asks you to provide
      or confirm any personal information:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Do NOT answer any questions.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Hang up immediately.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Call your bank or credit company directly and describe what
          happened.

      Whether reserving a hotel room, buying plane tickets, or making
      other travel arrangements, these tips will help you get the deal
      you’ve been promised:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Plan as far ahead as you
          can.</strong> Special deals on hotel rooms and airline seats
          often sell out very quickly.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Be flexible in your travel
          plans.</strong> Hotels usually offer better rates on days
          when they expect fewer guests. Once you get a fare quote from
          an airline, ask if you can save money by leaving a day earlier
          or later, by taking a different flight on the same day, or by
          using a different airport. Changing planes during your trip is sometimes cheaper
          than a nonstop flight.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Check out the seller.</strong> Ask
          tour operators and travel agents whether they belong to a
          professional association, then check to see if they are
          members in good standing. Contact your state or local consumer
          protection agency (p. 112) and the Better Business Bureau (p.
          67) to find their complaint history.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Comparison shop.</strong> Determine
          the complete cost of the trip in dollars, including all
          service charges, taxes, processing fees, etc.
        </p>
      </li><li>
      <p>
      <strong>Beware of unusually cheap prices and
      freebies.</strong> These could be a scam, and you could end up
      paying more than the cost of a regular package tour. See
      information on Drip Pricing on p. 2.
    </p>
    </li><li>
    <p>
      <strong>Make sure you understand the terms of
      the deal.</strong> If you hear you’ve won a free vacation, ask
      whether you have to buy something in order to get it. If the
      destination is a beach resort, ask the seller how far the hotel is
      from the beach. Then ask the hotel.
    </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Ask about cancellation
          policies.</strong> You may want to look into travel
          insurance for added protection (see 34). The website
          <a href="http://www.insuremytrip.com">www.insuremytrip.com</a>
          offers pricing and policy information on plans from different
          companies and describes the different forms of policies
          available.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Insist on written
          confirmations.</strong> Ask for written proof of
          reservations, rates, and dates.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          <strong>Pay by credit card.</strong> It’s
          not unusual to make a deposit or even pay in full for travel
          services before the trip. Paying by credit card gives you the
          right to dispute charges for services that were misrepresented
          or never delivered. If a travel agent or service provider says
          you can’t leave for at least two months, be very cautious— the
          deadline for disputing a credit card charge is 60 days, and
          most scam artists know this. (See Credit Card Billing
          Disputes, p. 13).
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      In some states, travel sellers must be registered and insured.
      Advance payments for travel must be placed in an escrow account
      until services are provided. Prizes or “free” gifts may also be
      regulated. Contact your state or local consumer protection agency
      (p. 112) to find out about your rights and how to file complaints.
      The American Society of Travel Agents (p. 143) also helps to
      resolve disputes with member agents.

    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Resolving Air Travel Problems</h1>
      
    <p>
      No matter how well you plan, you might encounter these common air
      travel hassles.
    </p>
    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Delayed and Canceled Flights</h2>
      
    <p>
      Airline delays caused by bad weather, traffic control problems,
      and mechanical repairs are hard to predict. If your flight is
      canceled, most airlines will rebook you on the earliest flight
      possible to your destination, at no additional charge. If you’re
      able to find a flight on another airline, ask the first airline 
      to endorse your ticket to the new
      carrier. This could save you from a fare increase, but there is no
      rule requiring the airline to do this.
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Airline Fees</h5>
    
    <p>
      Many airlines charge extra fees for checked baggage and some
      charge for carry-ons. Others charge for advance seat assignments,
      meals, unaccompanied minors, and other services. The Department of
      Transportation has ruled that an airline must prominently disclose
      all mandatory taxes and fees on their websites. The airline must
      also refund baggage fees if it loses your baggage. In addition,
      airlines are required to include all government taxes and fees in
      the advertised price. However, air carriers may still charge
      optional fees not included in the standard price. Each airline’s
      fee schedule is different, so check with the airline before you
      head to the airport. For more information, go to
      <a href="airconsumer.dot.gov/subjects.htm">airconsumer.dot.gov/subjects.htm</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep in mind—using frequent flyer points doesn’t necessarily mean
      you are exempt from additional fees. When booking a flight using
      frequent flyer points, airlines may still charge you a booking fee
      or pet fee.
    </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      Each airline has its own policies about what it will do for
      delayed passengers; there are no federal requirements. If your
      flight is delayed or canceled, ask the airline whether it will pay
      for meals or a phone call. Contrary to what many people believe,
      airlines are not required to do so.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Delayed or Damaged Bags</h2>
      
    <p>
      If your bags aren’t on the conveyor belt when you arrive, file a
      report with the airline before you leave the airport:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Insist the airline fill out a form and give you a copy, even
          if personnel say the bag will be on the next flight.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Get the name of the person who filled out the form and a phone
          number.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Confirm that the airline will deliver the bag to you without 
          charge when it’s found.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
       Some airlines will give you money
      to purchase a few necessities. If they don’t provide you with
      cash, ask what types of articles are reimbursable and keep all
      receipts.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a suitcase arrives damaged, the airline may pay for repairs if
      you file a claim immediately (before you leave the airport). If an
      item can’t be fixed, the airline will negotiate to pay you its
      depreciated value. The same is true for belongings packed inside a
      suitcase. However, airlines may refuse to pay for damage if it was
      caused by your failure to pack something properly rather than by
      the airline’s handling.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Lost Bags</h2>
      
    <p>
      If your bag is declared officially lost, you will have to submit a
      second, more detailed form within a time period set by the
      airline. The information on the form is used to estimate the value
      of your lost belongings. Airlines can limit their liability for
      delay, loss, and damage to baggage; however, they must prominently
      display a sign that explains the limit. According to the Office of
      Aviation Consumer Protection and Enforcement
      (<a href="airconsumer.ost.dot.gov/SA_Baggage_Limits.htm"/>),
      the maximum an airline pays on lost bags and their contents is
      limited to $3,300 per passenger on domestic flights, and
      approximately $1,500 per passenger for unchecked baggage on
      international flights. See
      <a href="http://www.thetravelinsider.info/travelaccessories/lostbaggagerights.htm">www.thetravelinsider.info/travelaccessories/lostbaggagerights.htm</a>
      for more information on maximum liability, including special rates
      that change daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the airline’s offer doesn’t cover your loss fully, check your
      homeowners or renters insurance to see whether it covers losses
      away from home. Some credit card companies and travel agencies
      also offer optional or even automatic supplemental baggage
      coverage.
    </p>
    <p>
      On those trips when you know you’re carrying more than the
      liability limits, you may want to ask about purchasing “excess
      valuation” from the airline when you check in. Of course, there is
      no guarantee the airline will sell you this protection. The
      airline may refuse, especially if the item is valuable or
      breakable.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Overbooked Flights</h2>
      
    <p>
      Selling more tickets than there are seats is not illegal. Most
      airlines overbook their flights to compensate for “no-shows.” If
      there are more passengers than seats just before a plane is
      scheduled to depart, you can be “bumped” or left behind against
      your will. Whether you are bumped may depend on when you
      officially checked in for your flight, so check-in early. The U.S.
      Department of Transportation requires airlines to ask people to
      give up their seats voluntarily, in exchange for compensation.
      Airlines decide what to offer volunteers, such as money, a free
      trip, food, or lodging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Federal rules protect you if you are “bumped” on most flights
      within the United States and on outbound international flights.
      Passengers who are bumped involuntarily are protected under
      Federal Aviation Administration
      guidelines (<a href="http:www.faa.gov"/>). If you volunteer to be bumped,
      your agreement with the airline is not regulated and will depend
      on negotiating at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The airline must give you a written statement describing your
      rights as well as the airline’s boarding priority rules and
      criteria. If the airline is not able to get you to your final
      destination within two hours of your original arrival time, you
      may be entitled to a maximum of $800 compensation if you are
      delayed (that is, more than two hours for domestic and four hours
      for international) from your original arrival time. The amount
      depends on the price of the ticket and the length of the delay. To
      receive this payment, you must have a confirmed reservation. You
      must also meet the airline’s deadlines for ticketing and check-in.
      An airline may offer you a free ticket on a future flight in place
      of a check, but you have the right to insist on a check.

    <p>
      Under new federal rules, U.S. airlines operating domestic flights
      must allow passengers to deplane after a tarmac delay of three
      hours. The only exceptions allowed are for safety or security, or
      if air traffic control advises the pilot otherwise. Carriers are
      also required to provide adequate food and drinking water within
      two hours of being delayed on the tarmac; they must also maintain
      operable lavatories and, if necessary, provide medical attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are other protections as well, such as prohibiting airlines
      from scheduling chronically delayed flights. For more information,
      go to

      A valid U.S. passport is required to enter and leave most foreign
      countries. The Passport Services Office provides information and
      services to American citizens about how to obtain, replace, or
      change a passport. All American citizens must now have a valid
      U.S. passport to re-enter the country, regardless of what nations
      they have been visiting while traveling. For more information on
      how to get a new passport, visit
      <a href="http://www.travel.state.gov/passport">www.travel.state.gov/passport</a>.

    <p>
      Acceptance facilities include many federal, state, and probate
      courts; post offices; some public libraries; and a number of
      county and municipal offices. There are also 25 regional passport
      agencies, and one Gateway City Agency, that serve customers who
      are traveling within two weeks (14 days), or who need foreign
      visas for travel. Appointments are required in such cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      To obtain a passport for the first time, you need to appear in
      person at one of 7,000 passport acceptance facilities located
      throughout the United States with:

      company’s record. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration
      (FMCSA) recommends that you contact the company and ask these
      questions:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Do the drivers hold valid Commercial Driver’s Licenses with a
          “passenger” endorsement?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Does the company comply with the Department of
          Transportation’s drug and alcohol testing requirements for
          drivers?
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>

    <figure float="0"><figcaption/><img src="images/pdf5131_img_34.png"/></figure>
    <p>
      In many states, consumers can choose their telephone and energy
      service provider. Contact your state utility commission (p. 138)
      to find out whether you have a choice. Some commissions will
      provide a list of service providers and advice on making a choice,
      and most state utility commissions will take any complaints you
      have concerning utility sales and service.
    </p>
    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Starting Utility Service</h1>
      
    <p>
      When you move into a new home or apartment, you may also be
      required to have the utilities (electricity, gas, water, waste
      removal, and cable) turned on in your name. Your city or county
      government may handle some services, such as water, sewer, and
      garbage collection. If you live in an apartment or are leasing a
      house from a homeowner, the landlord may handle this for you, but
      that is not required. If you request service, provide as much
      advance notice to the utility company as you can, at least one
      week in advance of the date you need service to start. Also, if
      you are relocating, don’t forget to have service turned off at
      your old address. Each company may require you to pay a fee to
      start service. You may also be required to pay a deposit or allow
      the company to check your credit to establish service at your
      home. If any of these companies fails to meet its service
      requirements, file a complaint with the company; you may be able
      to get a refund of your installation fee. If that doesn’t work,
      contact your state’s utility commission (p. 138).
    </p>
    </section>
    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Billing</h1>
      
    <p>
      Once you have established service, you should start receiving your
      bills at regular intervals, normally monthly or quarterly. Utility
      bills are based on the amount of energy or water you actually use.
      However, if you live in an apartment complex, the amount you pay
      for some utilities may be prorated or split, based on a
      mathematical formula, among all of the residents in your
      community, no matter how energy conscious you are; see Renting (p.
      30). If the amount of energy varies by season, you may decide to
      sign up for a budget billing program. These programs allow you to
      smooth out your monthly payments by paying more in lighter-use
      months, so your bills are still manageable in months with heavier
      use. Contact your utility companies to sign up for these programs.
      To learn ways to save on your energy bill, see Going Green (p.
      22).
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to your actual service, you may have other fees on
      your bill, such as administrative fees, public surcharges, or
      local taxes. Contact the service provider if you see charges you
      don’t understand or didn’t authorize, or if you have difficulty
      making timely payments.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have difficulty paying your bills, especially for
      electricity or gas, help is available. Contact the company to find
      out if it has a program in place to help consumers. Also, your
      state’s utility commission (p. 138) may sponsor a program to
      either reduce your bill or make your payments based on a set
      amount of your income each month. Programs like these from utility
      companies and local government are usually based on your income.

    <figure float="0"><figcaption/><img src="images/pdf5131_img_35.png"/></figure>
    <p>
      It’s unfortunate how many people believe that estate planning is
      only for the wealthy. People at all economic levels benefit from
      an estate plan. Upon death, an estate plan legally protects and
      distributes property based on your wishes and the needs of your
      family and/or survivors with the fewest tax consequences.
    </p>
    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Wills</h1>
      
    <p>
      A will is the most practical first step in estate planning. It
      makes clear how you want your property to be distributed after you
      die. Writing a will can be as simple as typing out how you want
      your assets to be transferred to loved ones or charitable
      organizations after your death. If you don’t have a will when you
      die, your estate will be handled in probate, and your property
      could be distributed differently from what you would like.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may help to get legal advice when writing a will, particularly
      when it comes to understanding all of the rules of the estate
      disposition process in your state. For information about legal
      issues, see page 58. Some states, for instance, have
      community-property laws that entitle your surviving spouse to keep
      half of your wealth after you die, no matter what percentage you
      leave him or her. Fees for the execution of a will vary according
      to its complexity.
    </p>
    </section>
    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Choose an Executor</h1>
      
    <p>
      An executor is the person who is responsible for settling the
      estate after death. Duties of an executor include:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Taking inventory of property and belongings
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Appraising and distributing assets
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Paying taxes
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Settling debts owed by the deceased
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      Most important, the
      executor is legally obligated to act in the interests of the
      deceased, following the wishes provided by the will. Here
      again, it can be helpful to consult an attorney to help with
      the probate process or offer legal guidance. In most states,
      any person over the age of 18 who hasn’t been convicted of a
      felony can be named executor of a will. Some people choose a
      lawyer, accountant, or financial consultant based on his or
      her professional experience. Others choose a spouse, adult
      child, relative, or friend. Since the role of executor can be 
      demanding, it’s often a good idea to ask the person if he or she
      is willing to serve.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’ve been named executor in someone’s
      will but are not able or do not want to serve, you need to file a
      “declination,” which is a legal document that declines your
      designation as an executor. The contingent executor named in the
      will then assumes responsibility. If no contingent executor is
      named, the court will appoint one.
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Rules To Remember When Writing A Will</h5>
      
<ul><li>
    <p>
      In most states, you must be 18 years of age or older.
    </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
      To be valid, a will must be written when you are of sound judgment 
      and have adequate mental capacity.
    </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
      The document must clearly state that it is your will.
    </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
      An executor of your will, who ensures your estate is 
      distributed according to your wishes, must be named.
    </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
      It is not necessary to notarize or record your will, 
      but doing so can safeguard any claims that it is invalid. 
      To be valid, you must sign a will in the presence of at 
      least two witnesses.
    </p>
  </li><li>
    <p>
      A financial will and testament will always supersede a 
      last will and testament when bestowing financial assets.

      <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Write A Social Media Will</h5>
        
        <p>
          Social media are a part of daily life, so what happens 
          to the online content you created once you die? If you 
          are active online, you should consider creating a social 
          media will, or statement of how you would like your online 
          identity to be handled. You should appoint someone you 
          trust as an online executor. This person will be responsible 
          for closing your email addresses, social media profiles, 
          and blogs after you are deceased.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take these steps to help you write a social media will:
        </p>
        <ul><li>
            <p>
              Review the privacy policies and the terms and conditions 
              of each website where you have a presence.
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              State how you would like your profiles to be handled. 
              You may want to cancel your profile completely or keep 
              it up for friends and family to visit. Some sites allow 
              users to create a memorial profile where other users can 
              still see your profile but can’t post anything new.
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              Give the responsible person a document that lists all 
              of the websites where you have a profile, along with 
              your usernames and passwords.
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              Stipulate in your will that the online executor should 
              have a copy of your death certificate. The online executor 
              may need this as proof for websites to take any actions on 
              your behalf.
            </p>

  <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Funerals</h1>
    
    <p>
      One of the most expensive purchases many consumers will ever make
      is arranging for a funeral. A traditional burial, including a
      casket and vault, costs about $7,000. Extras such as flowers,
      obituary notices, cards, and limousines can add thousands of
      dollars more. At such a highly emotional time, many people are
      easily swayed to believe that their decisions reflect how they
      feel about the deceased and wind up spending more than may be
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most funeral providers are professionals who work to serve their
      clients’ needs and best interests. Unfortunately, some do not.
      They may take advantage of clients by insisting on unnecessary
      services and overcharging consumers. That’s why there is a federal
      law, called the Funeral Rule that regulates the actions of funeral
      directors, homes, and services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many funeral providers offer a variety of package plans that
      include products and services that are most commonly sold. Keep in
      mind, you are not obligated to buy a package plan; you have the
      right to buy the individual products and services you prefer. As
      outlined by the Funeral Rule:
    </p>
    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>The Funeral Rule</h5>
      
    <p>
      A federal law makes it easier for you to choose only the goods and
      services you want or need when planning a funeral, and to pay only
      for those you select. The Funeral Rule, enforced by the FTC,
      requires funeral directors to give you itemized prices in person
      and, if you ask, over the phone.
    </p>
    </aside>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          You have the right to choose the funeral goods and services
          you want (with some exceptions).
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          The funeral provider must state this “Rule” in writing on the
          general price list.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          If state or local law requires you to buy any particular item,
          the funeral provider must disclose it on the price list, with
          a reference to the specific law.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          The funeral provider may not refuse, or charge a fee, to
          handle a casket that you bought elsewhere.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          A funeral provider who offers cremations must make alternative
          containers available.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          When prepaying for funeral services, do not agree to give the
          check from the life insurance company directly to the funeral
          home. You are paying for specific goods and services, and
          signing over the life insurance check might result in a
          significant overpayment for services rendered.
        </p>
      </li></ul>

    <p>
      Planning ahead is the best way to make informed decisions about funeral 
      arrangements. An advance plan also spares your family from having to 
      make choices in the middle of grief and under time constraints. 
      Every family is different, and funeral arrangements are influenced by 
      religious and cultural traditions, budgets, and personal preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are not legally required to use a funeral home to plan and conduct 
      a funeral, but most people find that the services of a professional 
      funeral home make the process easier.
    </p>

      Comparison shopping, either in person or by phone, can save you
      money and is much easier when done in advance. Visit
      <a href="http://www.funerals.org">www.funerals.org</a> to learn
      more about how to select a funeral home and research its history.
      Many funeral homes will also send you a price list by mail, but
      this is not required by law. If you have a problem concerning
      funeral matters, it’s best to try to resolve it first with the
      funeral director. If you are dissatisfied, the Funeral Consumers
      Alliance (p. 110) may be able to advise you on how best to resolve
      your issue. You can also contact your state or local consumer
      protection agencies (p. 112) or the Funeral Service Consumer
      Assistance Program at 1-800-662-7666. Most states have a licensing
      board that regulates the funeral industry. You can contact the
      board in your state for information or help.

    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Prepaying</h2>
      
    <p>
      Millions of Americans have entered into contracts to prearrange
      their funerals and prepay some or all of the expenses involved.
      Various states have laws to help ensure that these advance
      payments are available to pay for the funeral products and
      services when they’re needed; however, protections vary widely
      from state to state. Some state laws require the funeral home or
      cemetery to place a percentage of the prepayment in a
      state-regulated trust or to purchase a life insurance policy with
      the death benefits assigned to the funeral home or cemetery. For a
      list of questions to consider before prepaying for a funeral,

    <p>
      All veterans are entitled to a free burial in a national cemetery
      and a grave marker. This eligibility also applies to some
      civilians who have provided military-related service and some
      Public Health Service personnel. Spouses and dependent children
      also are entitled to a lot and marker when buried in a national
      cemetery. There are no charges for opening or closing the grave,
      for a vault or liner, or for setting the marker in a national

    <p>
      Even the savviest consumer has problems with a good or service at
      one time or another. It is your right to complain if you have a
      genuine consumer problem. It is also your responsibility. A
      problem can’t be fixed if no one knows it exists.
    </p>
    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Contact The Seller</h1>
      
    <p>
      The first step in resolving a consumer problem is contacting the
      seller. You can solve most consumer problems by talking to a
      salesperson or customer service representative. Do this as soon as
      possible because some retailers have time limits on returns and
      refunds. If this doesn’t work, ask for a supervisor or manager. If
      this fails, try going higher up to the national headquarters of
      the seller or the manufacturer of the item. Many companies have a
      special customer relations or consumer affairs division whose
      primary function is solving consumer problems. Many companies
      provide a toll-free number or address for this office on the
      product label, warranty, or other papers you received at the time
      of purchase. If this is not the case:
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Check the Corporate Consumer Directory portion of this
          Handbook for the contact information of several hundred
          corporations (p. 72).
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Visit the company’s website and look for a “Contact Us” link.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Dial the directory of toll-free numbers at 1-800-555-1212 to
          see whether the company has a toll-free number listed.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask your local librarian to assist you. Most public libraries
          have reference books with contact information.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          As you do your search, keep in mind that the name of the
          manufacturer or parent company is often different from the
          brand name. The Thomas Register of American Manufacturers, a
          book available at many public libraries, lists the
          manufacturers of thousands of products.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          With each person you contact, calmly and accurately explain
          the problem and what action you would like to be taken. A
          written letter is a good strategy because you will have a
          record of your communication with the company. The sample
          letter (p. 57) will help you prepare a written complaint.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Be brief and to the point. Note all important facts about your
          purchase, including what you bought, serial or model numbers,
          the name and location of the seller, and when you made the
          purchase.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          State exactly what you want done about the problem and how
          long you are willing to wait for a response. Be reasonable.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Don’t write an angry, sarcastic, or threatening letter. The
          person reading your letter probably was not responsible for
          your problem but could be very helpful in resolving it.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Send your letter as certified mail or request delivery
          confirmation.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Include copies of all documents regarding your problem. Keep
          the originals.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Provide your name, address, and phone numbers. If an account
          is involved, be sure to include the account number.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Keep a record of your efforts to contact the seller; include
          the name of the person with whom you spoke and what was done,
          if anything.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    </section>
  <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Contact Third Parties</h1>
    
    <p>
      Don’t give up if you are not satisfied with the seller’s response
      to your complaint. Once you have given the seller a reasonable
      amount of time to respond, consider filing a complaint with one or
      more of these outside organizations:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>State or local consumer protection offices</strong> 
      (p. 112). These government agencies mediate complaints, conduct 
      investigations, and prosecute those who break consumer laws.
     </p>
    <p>
      <strong>State regulatory agencies</strong> that have jurisdiction 
      over the business. For example, banking (p. 126), insurance
      130), securities (p. 134), and utilities (p. 138) are regulated at
      the state level.

    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>File A Complaint Using Social Media</h5>
      
    <p>
      Social media offer an alternative to filing a formal consumer
      complaint. The customer relations staff at many major corporations
      monitor posts and complaints about their company’s service.
      Someone may respond to your problem quickly, to avoid negative
      perceptions of their company’s performance by other potential
      customers. While there is no guarantee that you’ll get your
      problem resolved, it can be a worthwhile effort.
    </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      <strong>Local politicians.</strong> Your local
      and state politicians may be able to help you get your complaint addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>State and local licensing
      agencies.</strong> Doctors, lawyers, home improvement
      contractors, auto repair shops, debt collectors, and child care
      providers are required to register or be licensed. The board or
      agency that oversees this process may handle complaints and have
      the authority to take disciplinary action. Your state or local
      consumer protection office (p. 112) can help you identify the
      appropriate agency.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Better Business Bureaus</strong> (p.
      67). This network of nonprofit organizations supported by local
      businesses tries to resolve buyer complaints against sellers.
      Records are kept on unresolved complaints as a source of
      information for the seller’s future customers. The umbrella
      organization for the BBBs assists with complaints concerning the
      truthfulness of national advertising and helps to settle disputes
      with automobile manufacturers through the BBB AUTO LINE program (p. 66).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Trade associations.</strong>
      Companies selling similar products or services often belong to an
      industry association that will help resolve problems between its 
      members and consumers (p. 142).
</p>
    <p>
    <strong>National consumer
      organizations.</strong> Some of these organizations assist 
      consumers with complaints. Others may be
      unable to help individuals but are interested in hearing about
      problems that could influence their education and advocacy efforts
      (p. 109).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Media programs.</strong> Local
      newspapers, radio stations, and television stations often have
      action lines or hotline services that try to resolve consumer
      complaints they receive. Call for Action, Inc. is a nonprofit
      network of consumer hotlines that educate and assist consumers
      with consumer problems. For more information, visit

  </section>
  <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Dispute Resolution Programs</h1>
    
    <p>
      Some companies and industries offer programs to address
      disagreements between buyers and sellers. The auto industry (p.
      66) has several of these programs. The Financial Industry
      Regulatory Authority (FINRA) offers a program to resolve
      investment-related disputes (p. 66). Some small claims courts also
      offer a dispute resolution program as an alternative to a trial.
      The American Bar Association (p. 142) also publishes a directory
      of state and local dispute resolution programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mediation, arbitration, and conciliation are three common types of
      dispute resolution. During mediation, both sides involved in the
      dispute meet with a neutral third party and create their own
      agreement jointly. In arbitration, the third party decides how to
      settle the problem. Conciliation is similar; however, you and the
      other party meet with the conciliator separately (not a group
      meeting). Request a copy of the rules of any program before
      deciding to participate. You will want to know beforehand whether
      the decision is binding; some programs do not require both parties
      to accept the decision. Also ask whether participation in the
      program places any restrictions on your ability to take other
      legal action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some contracts include a clause that prohibits you from taking
      legal action and require you to engage in mandatory arbitration
      with a company in the case of a dispute. The clause may limit your
      ability to take a case to court. Be sure to read contracts
      carefully to see whether they include a mandatory arbitration
      clause. If you do not wish to be prohibited from taking legal
      action if needed, you can choose not to purchase an item from the
      company. If you have no other option, write on the contract that
      you don’t agree with the clause and initial next to the statement.
    </p>
  </section>
    <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Small Claims Court</h1>
      
    <p>
      Small claims courts resolve disputes over small amounts of money.
      While the maximum amount that can be claimed differs from state to
      state, court procedures are generally simple, inexpensive, quick,
      and informal. Court fees are minimal, and you often get your
      filing fee back if you win your case. Typically, you will not need
      a lawyer— some states do not permit them. If you live in a state
      that allows lawyers, and the party you are suing brings one, don’t
      be intimidated. Most judges make allowances for consumers who
      appear without lawyers. Even though the court is informal, the
      judge’s decision must be followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you file a case and win, the losing party should give you what
      the court says you are owed without further action on your part.
      But some losers refuse to follow the court’s decision. When this
      happens, you can go back to court and ask for the order to be
      enforced. Depending on local laws, law enforcement officials might
      sell a person’s property or take money from a bank account or
      business cash register. If the person who owes the money receives
      a salary, the court might order an employer to garnish (deduct
      money from) each paycheck to pay you.

    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>Tips for Choosing an Attorney</h2>
      
    <p>
      Many lawyers who primarily serve individuals and families are
      general practitioners with experience in frequently needed legal
      services, such as divorce and family matters, wills and probate,
      bankruptcy and debt problems, real estate, and criminal and/or
      personal injury. Some have a narrower focus. Be sure the lawyer
      you are considering has experience in the area for which you are
      seeking help.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Once you’ve identified some candidates:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul><li>
        <p>
          Call each attorney on the telephone, describe your legal
          issue, and find out whether he or she handles your situation.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask if you will be charged for an initial consultation.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask for an estimate of what the lawyer usually charges to
          handle your kind of case.
        </p>
      </li><li>
        <p>
          Ask whether there are hourly charges or your attorney accepts
          a percentage of the settlement as a fee contingency.
        </p>
      </li></ul>
    <p>
      The initial consultation is an opportunity for you and the lawyer
      to get to know each other. After listening to the description of
      your case, the lawyer should be able to outline your rights and
      liabilities as well as alternative courses of action. The initial
      consultation is the lawyer’s opportunity to explain what he or she
      can do for you and how much it will cost. You should not hesitate
      to ask about the attorney’s experience in handling matters such as
      yours. Also, do not hesitate to ask about the lawyer’s fees and
      the likely results. If you are considering going beyond the
      initial consultation and hiring the lawyer, request a written fee
      agreement before proceeding.

    <section data-type="sect2"><h2>What If You Can’t Afford a Lawyer?</h2>
      
    <p>
      If you cannot afford a lawyer, you may qualify for free legal help
      from a Legal Aid or Legal Services Corporation (LSC) office. These
      offices generally offer legal assistance for such things as
      landlord-tenant relations, credit, utilities, family matters (for
      example, divorce and adoption), foreclosure, home equity fraud,
      Social Security, welfare, unemployment, and workers’ compensation.

      <section data-type="sect1"><h1>Report Fraud And Safety Hazard</h1>
        
    <p>
      If you suspect a law has been violated, contact your local or
      state consumer protection agency (p. 112). This agency may take
      action or refer you to another state organization that has
      authority where you live. A local law enforcement officer may also
      be able to provide advice and assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violations of federal laws should be reported to the federal
      agency responsible for enforcement. While federal agencies are
      rarely able to act on behalf of individual consumers, complaints
      are used to document patterns of abuse, allowing the agency to
      take action against a company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout Part I of this <em>Handbook</em>, you will
      find references to federal agencies you can contact for more
      information, which is usually the same agency to contact with your
      complaint. You can also find the appropriate federal agency by
      using the Federal Agency Directory (p. 96).

        <p>
          Report scams that use the mail or interstate delivery service
          to the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (p. 108). It is illegal

    <p>
      Disasters can strike in many forms—fires, floods, hurricanes,
      tornadoes, and even national emergencies. Protecting yourself,
      your family, your pets, and your home or your business requires
      advance planning. It is equally important to know where to turn
      for help and information. You may even be eligible for government
      assistance.

    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Services And Resources For Consumers With Disabilities</h5>
      
    <p>
      <strong>Relay Services:</strong> Telecommunications 
      relay services link telephone conversations
      between individuals who use standard voice telephones and those
      who use text telephones (TTYs). Calls may be made from either type
      of telephone to the other type through the relay service.
</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Local Relay Services</strong>:
      States provide relay services for local and long-distance 
      calls. Consult your local telephone directory for information 
      on use, fees (if any), services, and dialing instructions 
      for that area.
</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Federal Relay
      Service</strong>: The FRS, a program of the U.S. 
      General Services Administration (GSA), provides access to 
      TTY users who wish to conduct official business nationwide 
      with and within the federal government. The toll-free 
      number is 1-866-377-8642. For more information on relay 
      communications or to obtain a brochure on using the FRS, 
      call 1-800-877-0996.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Other Services</strong>: Consumers who
      are deaf or hard of hearing, or who have speech impairment and use a TTY,
      may receive operator and directory assistance for calls by
      calling 1-800-855-1155. Check the introductory pages of your
      local telephone directory for additional TTY services.

      Today’s military families face many common consumer challenges as
      well as the additional stress associated with frequent separation.
      To ease such difficulties, Family Centers, along with the other
      programs described below, provide help and support for military families.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>U.S. Military Family Centers</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Located on most military installations, Family Centers provide
      information, life skills education, and support services to
      military members and their families. One key function of the
      Family Center is to link customers with appropriate services
      available in the local community and/or through state and federal
      assistance programs such as those related to health and human
      services, school systems, employment assistance, law enforcement,
      and recreation.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you cannot locate a Family Center, contact your respective
      military branch’s headquarters office listed below. The
      designation “DSN,” preceding some of the phone numbers, refers to
      the military phone system and does not apply to the civilian
      sector.

    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Predatory Lending Restrictions</h5>
      
    <p>
      As of October 1, 2007, the Talent-Nelson Amendment to the John
      Warner National Defense Authorization Act allows the Department of
      Defense to regulate the terms of payday loans, vehicle title
      loans, and tax refund loans to active-duty service members and
      their dependents. These three products have high interest rates,
      coupled with short payback terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rule for service members and their dependents limits the
      Military Annual Percentage Rate (MAPR) on these loans to 36%. All
      fees and charges should be included in calculating the rate. The
      rule also prohibits contracts requiring the use of a check or
      access to a bank account, mandatory arbitration, or unreasonable
      legal notice. Any credit agreement subject to this regulation that
      fails to comply with the regulation is void and cannot be
      enforced. The rule further provides that a creditor or assignee
      that knowingly violates the regulation shall be subject to certain
      criminal penalties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Department of Defense strongly encourages service members and
      their families to choose alternatives that specifically help
      resolve financial crises, rebuild credit ratings, and establish
      savings for emergencies. Payday loans, vehicle title loans, and
      tax refund loans can propel an already overextended borrower into
      a deeper spiral of debt.

      them, with a web-based “yellow book.” It has information on, and
      access to, the full range of medical and non-medical services and
      resources needed to achieve their personal and professional goals
      across the transitions from recovery to rehabilitation to
      community reintegration. The National Resource Directory, an
      online partnership of the departments of Defense, Labor, and
      Veterans Affairs, provides links to the services and resources of
      federal, state, and local government agencies; veterans’ service,
      nonprofit, community-based, and philanthropic organizations;
      professional associations; and academic institutions.

    <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Contacting Your Automotive Manufacturer</h5>
      
<p>
  If you have a problem with a car purchased from a local dealer, first try to work
  it out with the dealer. If the problem is not resolved, contact the manufacturer’s
  regional or national office. Ask for the Consumer Affairs Office.
</p>
      <p>
        If you are still unsuccessful, consider contacting the automotive dispute
        resolution resources listed at the end of this section. The method used to
        resolve your dispute may be mediation, arbitration, or conciliation. Decisions
        of arbitrators are usually binding and must be accepted by both the customer
        and the business. Ask for a copy of the rules of the program before you file
        your case. See page 55 for an overview of dispute resolution programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        A local or state consumer agency (p. 112) could also be a useful resource in
        resolving problems with your vehicle. If you have a new vehicle, be sure to ask
        whether you have any protection under a state “lemon” law (p. 10).

      NCDS is a neutral administrator of the dispute resolution process.
      NCDS facilitates the process under their rules, but is not the
      decision maker, rather the decision is made by an independent
      arbitrator.

      <p>An automotive dispute resolution program is another 
        resource to consult if you need to solve a problem with 
        your car’s manufacturer or dealership.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have been unable to reach an agreement with your 
        manufacturer, consider contacting the automotive dispute 
        resolution resources listed here.
      </p>
      <p>
        The method used to resolve your dispute may be mediation, 
        arbitration, or conciliation. Decisions of arbitrators are 
        usually binding and must be accepted by both the customer 
        and the business. Ask for a copy of the rules of the program 
        before you file your case.
    </p>
      <p>
        Read the contract that you signed when you purchased your car. 
        Manufacturers and dealers may have included a clause that 
        requires you to agree to mandatory arbitration, waiving 
        your right to sue or settle a disagreement in a court of law.

      <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Contacting Your Local Better Business Bureau</h5>
        
        <p>
          Better Business Bureaus (BBBs) are non-profit organizations 
          that encourage honest advertising and selling practices, and 
          are supported primarily by local businesses. BBBs offer a 
          variety of consumer services, including consumer education 
          materials; business reports, particularly unanswered or 
          unsettled complaints or other problems; mediation and arbitration 
          services; and information about charities and other organizations 
          that are seeking public donations. They also provide ratings (A, 
          B, C, D, or F) of local companies to express the BBB’s confidence 
          that the company operates in a trustworthy manner and demonstrates 
          a willingness to resolve customer concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Complaints should be submitted in writing so that an accurate 
          record exists of the dispute. The BBB will then present the 
          complaint to the company involved. If the complaint is not 
          resolved, the BBB may offer an alternative dispute settlement 
          process. BBBs do not judge or rate individual products or brands, 
          handle employer/employee wage disputes, or give legal advice.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you need help with a consumer question or complaint, call 
          your local BBB or visit its website.
        </p>
        <p>
          BBBOnLine (<a href="http://www.bbb.org/online"/>) provides 
          Internet users an easy way to verify the legitimacy of online 
          businesses. Companies carrying the BBBOnLine seal have been 
          checked out by the BBB and agree to resolve customer concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Council of Better Business Bureaus, the umbrella organization 
          for the BBBs, can assist with complaints about the truthfulness 
          and accuracy of national advertising claims, including children’s 
          advertising; provide reports on national soliciting charities; and 
          help to settle disputes with automobile manufacturers through the 
          BBB Auto Line program (p. 66).

      <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Contacting Corporate Consumer Affairs Departments</h5>
        
        <p>
          The following directory lists the addresses and phone 
          numbers for hundreds of corporations. Many companies 
          have a consumer affairs department that handles consumer 
          questions and concerns. Consumer affairs offices are set 
          up within companies because they want to hear from you. 
          If you do not find the company you are looking for, try 
          checking your public libraries for the following resources:
        </p>
        <ul><li>
            <p>
              <em>The Standard and Poor’s Register of Corporations, Directors and Executives</em>
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              <em>Trade Names Directory</em>
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              <em>Standard Directory of Advertisers</em>
            </p>
          </li><li>
            <p>
              <em>Dun and Bradstreet Directory</em>
            </p>
          </li></ul>
        <p>To identify the name of a company that manufactures a 
          specific product, check the product label and other documents 
          given to you at the time of your purchase. The Thomas Register 
          of American Manufacturers, another resource available at many 
          public libraries, might also be helpful. It lists the 
          manufacturers of thousands of products.</p>
        <p>
          If you have a complaint about an item or service, it is 
          usually best to go back to the seller BEFORE you contact 
          the companies in this directory. Follow up with a letter, 
          phone call, or e-mail message to the consumer affairs 
          department of the company to let it know about your 
          complaint and whether the seller was able to resolve your 
          problem. You may express your complaint on a company’s 
          social media profile to get quick attention to your problem.

        <p>
          Many federal agencies have enforcement and/or 
          complaint-handling duties for products and services 
          used by the general public. Others act for the benefit 
          of the public, but do not resolve individual consumer 
          problems. Agencies also create printed publications, and 
          websites that may be helpful when making purchase 
          decisions or dealing with consumer problems. Some agencies 
          provide timely information to citizens through profile pages 
          and videos on social media outlets, blogs, text messages, 
          and news feeds. If you need help in deciding which federal 
          agency to contact, check the index at the end of this book 
          or call 1-800-333-4636.

      stop, and avoid them. To file a complaint or to get free
      information on consumer issues, visit ftc.gov or call the toll
      free number above. The FTC records consumer complaints (Internet,
      telemarketing, identity theft, and other fraud-related complaints)
      into the Consumer Sentinel Network, a secure, online database and
      investigative tool available to hundreds of civil and criminal law
      enforcement agencies. The FTC does not investigate individual
      consumer complaints, but will investigate trends that they see

      <aside data-type="sidebar"><h5>Contacting Your Local Consumer Protection Offices</h5>
    
    <p>
      State, county, and city consumer protection offices offer a
      variety of important services. They might mediate complaints,
      conduct investigations, prosecute offenders of consumer laws,
      license and regulate professionals, provide educational materials,
      and advocate in the consumer interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      An advantage of contacting a city or county government office is
      that it is familiar with local businesses, ordinances, and state
      laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other local consumer and non-profit organizations may provide
      consumer assistance and work with the state consumer office. Be
      sure to contact your state consumer protection office to get more
      information about other local resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before sending a written complaint, call the office to confirm
      that it handles the type of complaint you have and determine
      whether complaint forms are provided. Many offices distribute
      consumer materials specifically geared to state laws and local
      issues. Ask whether any information is available regarding your
      problem.

          Agencies on page 96. Also see the chart in the Banking section on page 7.

          State securities regulators protect the investing public. 
          Each state has its own laws and regulations for securities 
          brokers and securities, including stocks, mutual funds, 
          commodities, real estate, and more. The agencies listed 
          below enforce these laws and regulations. They also license 
          securities professionals, register securities, and investigate 
          consumer complaints. While these agencies do not provide 
          investment advice, many of them offer educational resources 
          so investors can make informed investment decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a question or complaint about an investment, 
          call the company or bank involved. If you are not satisfied 
          with the response you get, call your state securities agency. 
          See the Investing section in Part I of this Handbook for 
          additional advice and sources of assistance (p. 35).

        <p>
        State utilities commissions regulate services 
        and rates for gas, electricity, and telephones 
        in your state. In some states, the utility commissions 
        regulate other services such as water, transportation, 
        and the moving of household goods. Rates for utilities 
        and services provided between states are regulated by 
        the federal government.
        </p>
        <p>
        Many utilities commissions handle consumer complaints. 
        Sometimes, if they receive a number of complaints about the 
        same utility matter, they will conduct investigations.

      <p>
        Companies that manufacture similar products or offer 
        similar services often belong to an industry association. 
        These associations help resolve problems between their 
        member companies and consumers. Most also provide 
        consumer information through publications and websites.
      </p>
        <p>
          If you have a problem with a company and cannot resolve 
          it by working directly with that firm, ask whether the 
          company is a member of an association. Then check this 
          section to see whether the association is listed. If the 
          association is not included here, your local library has 
          reference materials to help you find the appropriate contact.
